=====================================

G-1: بروتوكول رعاية المريض العامة (General Patient Care Protocol)
=====================================

الاستجابة للمشهد بطريقة آمنة. للحصول على إرشادات سلامة المشهد، راجع G-4.
أداء تقييم المشهد. للحصول على إرشادات تقييم المشهد، راجع G-3.
النظر في الحاجة إلى عزل سطح الجسم (BSI). للحصول على إرشادات BSI، راجع G-2.

تحديد الفئة العمرية للمريض:
- المرضى الأطفال: أقل من 14 سنة
- البالغون: أكثر من 14 سنة
- إذا كان عمر المريض غير محدد، ابحث عن الخصائص الجنسية الثانوية
- الخصائص الجنسية الثانوية تشمل نمو الثديين عند الإناث وشعر الوجه عند الذكور
- إذا كان هناك شك أو نمو غير منتظم، عامل المريض حسب بنيته الجسدية

علاج الحالات المهددة للحياة فور تحديدها.

أداء التقييم الأولي من خلال تقييم ABCs للمريض:
- تقييم سالكية وحماية المجرى الهوائي
- تقييم إيقاع التنفس ومعدله والتساوي على كلا الجانبين
- تقييم الدورة الدموية للمريض وما إذا كان هناك نزيف نشط

التعريف بالنفس وطلب الإذن من المريض لتقديم الرعاية الطبية:
- إذا كان المريض في حالة تغير أو غير قادر على إعطاء الإذن، أبلغ الحاضرين بنيتك لفحص وعلاج المريض
- إذا كنت تعتقد أن حالة طوارئ طبية موجودة أو قد تكون موجودة، تابع إدارة المريض حتى بدون إذن
- إذا رفض المريض الرعاية، راجع إرشادات رفض الرعاية S-4

تقييم آلية الإصابة لمرضى الرضوض. النظر في الحاجة إلى تثبيت العمود الفقري.

الحصول على العلامات الحيوية للمريض:
- تقييم معدل ضربات القلب
- معدل التنفس
- تشبع الأكسجين
- ضغط الدم
- درجة الحرارة
- درجة الألم
- الحالة العقلية

الحصول على الشكوى الرئيسية وتاريخ المرض الحالي:
- السؤال عن التاريخ الطبي و/أو الجراحي السابق
- السؤال عن الحساسية
- الحصول على قائمة بالأدوية الحالية
- إذا كان لدى المريض خزانة أدوية أو حقيبة، اطلب الإذن للنظر فيها وتدوين الأدوية والوثائق الطبية
- أخذ جميع الوثائق والأدوية ذات الصلة إلى المستشفى

أداء التقييم الثانوي الموجه بالشكوى الرئيسية بما في ذلك الفحص.

إنشاء وصول وريدي/داخل العظم للمرضى غير المستقرين أو المرضى المحتمل عدم استقرارهم. راجع إرشادات الوصول الوريدي وداخل العظم P-7 و P-8.

لا تسمح للمرضى غير المستقرين بالوقوف أو المشي إلى سيارة الإسعاف.

تقييم وإعداد المريض للنقل خلال 15 دقيقة:
- إذا لم يكن المريض بحاجة إلى الاستلقاء للنقل، حمّل المريض بأمان في كرسي السلالم
- إذا كان المريض بحاجة إلى الاستلقاء للنقل، حمّل المريض بأمان على النقالة
- اخفض النقالة قدر الإمكان أثناء النقل لتقليل خطر السقوط
- إذا كان المريض محاصراً، استمر في تقديم الرعاية الطبية أثناء إخراج المريض

تقييد المريض بشكل مناسب. تأكد من تأمين المريض لجهاز النقل قبل الحركة.

تأمين جميع الأجهزة والمعدات في سيارة الإسعاف قبل القيادة. يجب على جميع الركاب ارتداء أحزمة الأمان في جميع الأوقات.

لا تستخدم الأضواء والصفارة إلا إذا تم ترخيص النقل كـ "ساخن" من قبل المرسل أو المدير الطبي؛ أو كان المريض يعاني من حالة حادة مهددة للحياة تتطلب تدخلاً حساساً للوقت.

نقل المريض إلى أقرب مستشفى إلا إذا كان هناك سبب وجيه لتجاوز المستشفى. راجع إرشادات تجاوز المستشفى S-8.

إعطاء تأييد شفهي باستخدام الطريقة التالية:
- تقرير موجز للمرضى الحرجين باستخدام SBAR، يتبعه تقرير مفصل بمجرد أن يكون لدى الفريق المعالج القدرة العقلية لاستقباله
- تقرير مفصل للمرضى المستقرين باستخدام SBAR

إذا كان فريق المستشفى مشغولاً أو غير متاح، استمر في رعاية المريض حتى يصبح متاحاً.

توثيق جميع أحداث الرعاية في تقرير رعاية المريض.

تنظيف سيارة الإسعاف للمريض التالي. إذا كانت سيارة الإسعاف تحتاج إلى تنظيف نهائي، اتصل بالعمليات.

Code: G-1

Title: General patient care

START

Respond to the scene in a safe manner. For scene safety guidelines go to G-4.
Perform scene size up. For scene size up guidelines go to G-3.
Consider the need for Body Surface Isolation (BSI). For BSI guidelines go to G-2.
Determine the age group of the patient. Ask the patient or their relatives about
their age.
- Pediatric patients are <14 years old.
- Adults are >14 years old. If a patient is of undetermined age, look of secondary
sexual features and if they are present then the patient is an adult. Secondary
sexual features include developing breasts in female patients and facial hair for
male patients. If still in doubt or the patient has growth irregularity, treat the
patient based on their body built. If they look small treat them as pediatric
patients.
Treat life threatening conditions as soon as they are identified.

EMT

PARAMEDIC

Perform a primary assessment by assessing the patient’s ABCs. Assess the airway
patency and protection. Assess the breathing rhythm, rate and equality on both
sides. Assess the patient circulation and whether an active bleeding is present.
Introduce yourself and ask the patient for permission to provide medical care. If
the patient is altered or unable to give permission, inform attendance of your
intention to examine and treat the patient. If you believe a medical emergency
exist or might exist, proceed to manage the patient even without permission. If the
patient refuse care, refer to refusal of care guidelines S-4.
Evaluate the mechanism of injury for trauma patients. Consider the need for
immobilization of the spine.
Obtain the patient’s vital signs. Assess the patient heart rate, respiratory rate,
oxygen saturation, blood pressure and respiratory rate. Assess the patient
temperature, pain score and mental status.
Obtain a chief complaint and history of present illness. Ask for past medical and or
surgical history. Ask about allergy. Obtain a list of current medications. If the
patient has a drug cabinet or bag, ask permission to look at it and take note of
medications and medical documents. Take all relevant documents and medications
to the hospital.
Perform a secondary assessment guided by the chief complaint including
examination.
Establish an IV/IO access for unstable patients or patients who are potentially
unstable. Refer to IV and IO access guidelines P-7 and P-8.
Do not allow patients who are unstable to stand or walk to the ambulance.

8

Assess and prepare the patient for transportation within 15 minutes!
• If the patient doesn’t need to be supine for transport, load the patient safely
into a stair chair.
• If the patient needs to be supine for transport, load the patient safely to the
stretcher. Lower the stretcher as much as possible during transport to minimize fall
risk.
• If the patient is entrapped, continue providing medical care while the patient is
being extricated. .
Restrain the patient appropriately. Make sure the patient is secured to the
transportation device before moving.

EMT

PARAMEDIC

Secure all devices and equipment in the ambulance before driving. All passengers
should wear seatbelts all the time.
Do not use lights and siren unless the transport has been authorized as “hot” by
dispatch or medical director; or the patient has an acute life-threatening condition
requiring time sensitive intervention.
Transport the patient to the closest hospital except if there a valid reason for
hospital bypass. Refer to hospital bypass guidelines S-8.
Give a verbal endorsement using the following method:
• Brief report for critical patients using SBAR, followed by detailed report once the
treating team has the mental capacity to receive it.
• Detailed report for stable patients using SBAR.
If the hospital team is busy or not available, continue to care for the patient until
they are.
Document all events of care in the patient care report.
Clean the ambulance for the next patient. If the ambulance needs terminal
cleaning, contact operations.

11

Code: G-2

Title: Body surface isolation/ Personal protective equipment (PPE)

START

Wear gloves on all calls where contact with blood or body fluid (including wound
drainage, urine, vomit, feces, diarrhea, saliva, nasal discharge) is anticipated or
when handling items or equipment that may be contaminated with blood or other
body fluids.
Wash your hands often and after every call. Wash hands even after using gloves:
a)

Use water with soap and wash for 40 seconds before rinsing and drying.

b)

If water is not available, use alcohol or a hand-cleaning germicide.

Keep all open cuts and abrasions covered with adhesive bandages that repel
liquids. (e.g. cover with commercial occlusive dressings or medical gloves).
Use goggles or glasses when spraying or splashing of body fluids is possible. (e.g.
spitting or arterial bleed). As soon as possible, the EMS practitioner should wash
face, neck and any other body surfaces exposed or potentially exposed to splashed
body fluids.

Prevent exposure to respiratory diseases:
a. Respiratory precautions must be used when caring for any patient with a
known or suspected infectious disease that is transmitted by respiratory droplets. (e.g., tuberculosis, influenza, SARS or Covid-19)

EMT

PARAMEDIC

Use pocket masks with filters/ one-way valves or bag-valve-masks when ventilating
a patient.

b. Surgical mask (N-95 during an aerosol generating procedure (AGP) such as
perform CPR or Endotracheal intubation or administer high flow Oxygen),
gowns, goggles/face shield and gloves should be worn during patient contact.
c. A mask should be placed upon the patient if his/her respiratory condition
permits.
d. Notify receiving facility of patient’s condition so appropriate isolation room
can be prepared.
Thoroughly clean and disinfect equipment after each use following agency guidelines that are consistent with Weqaya recommendations.
Place all disposable equipment and contaminated trash in a clearly marked yellow
plastic Biohazard bag and dispose of appropriately.
a. Contaminated uniforms and clothing should be removed, placed in an appropriately marked yellow Biohazard bag and laundered / decontaminated.
b. All needles and sharps must be disposed of in a sharp container and disposed
of appropriately.
Code: G-2

Title: Body surface isolation/ Personal protective equipment (PPE)

END
12

Key Points:
a. These guidelines should be used whenever contact with patient body substances is anticipated and/or when cleaning areas or equipment contaminated with blood or other body
fluids.
b. Your patients may have communicable diseases without you knowing it; therefore, these
guidelines should be followed for care of all patients
c. These guidelines provide general information related to body substance isolation and the
use of universal precautions. These guidelines are not designed to supersede an EMS agency’s infection control policy
d. These guidelines do not comprehensively cover all possible situations, and EMS practitioner
judgment should be used when the EMS agency’s infection control policy does not provide
specific direction.

e. At-risk exposure is defined as “a percutaneous injury (e.g. needle stick or cut with a sharp
object) or contact of mucous membrane or non-intact skin (e.g. exposed skin that is
chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis) with blood, tissue or other body fluids that
are potentially infectious.” Other “potentially” infectious materials (risk of transmission is
unknown) are CSF (cerebral spinal fluid), synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial and amniotic fluid, semen and vaginal secretions. Feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat,
tears, urine and vomitus are not considered potentially infectious unless they contain
blood.

f. An Aerosol Generating Procedure (AGP) is any procedure likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing.
AGPs potentially put healthcare personnel and others at an increased risk for pathogen
exposure and infection, including to COVID-19.

g. Some common AGPs:

• Open suctioning of airways
• Sputum induction
• Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
• Endotracheal intubation and extubation
• Non-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP)
• Bronchoscopy
• Manual ventilation
• High flow oxygen delivery
• Nebulizer administration

2. Hazardous substances (Chemical, Biological)
3. Violence (patient, bystanders, crime scenes)
4. Rescue (motor vehicle collisions: extrication hazards / roadway operation dangers)
Evaluation of the scene – Is the scene safe?
1. Yes – establish patient contact and proceed with your patient assessment.
2. No – is it possible to quickly and safely make the scene safe?
b) No – do not enter any unsafe scene until hazards are minimized and you have
deemed the scene safe.
EMT

PARAMEDIC

a) Yes – proceed with your patient assessment once scene is safe

3. Request specialized resources as soon as possible, i.e. police, fire, etc.
Scene Management:
A- Impact of the environment of patient care:
1. Medical (Determine nature of illness, Hazards at medical emergency scenes).
2. Trauma (Determine mechanism of injury, Hazards at trauma emergency
scenes).
3. Environmental considerations (Weather conditions, Toxins and gases, Secondary collapse and falls, Unstable conditions).
B- Addressing Hazards:
1. Protect the patient: After declaring the scene is safe for responders, the safety
of the patient becomes the next priority, if you cannot alleviate the conditions
that represent a health or safety threat to the patient, move the patient to a
safer environment.
2. Protect bystanders: Minimize conditions that represent a hazard for bystanders, If you cannot minimize hazards, remove bystanders from the scene.
3. Request additional resources: (Multiple patients – multiple ambulances, Fire
hazard – fire department, Traffic or violence issues – law enforcement).
4. Survey the scene for information related to: Mechanism of injury and Nature
of illness

16

C- Violence:
1. Personnel should not enter a scene or approach a patient if the threat of
violence exists.
2. Park away from the scene (safe distance and/or not visible to people at the
scene) and wait for the appropriate law enforcement to minimize the danger
and deem the scene safe.
D- Need for additional or specialized resources:
1. A variety of specialized protective equipment and gear is available for specialized situations. You need to know what is available to you within your area:

Code: G-3

b) Specialized rescue equipment may be necessary for difficult or complicated
extrications.
c) Ascent or descent gear may be necessary for specialized rescue situations.
2. Only trained responders should wear or used specialized equipment.
E- Standard precautions:
EMT

PARAMEDIC

Title: Scene Size-Up

a) Chemical and biological suits can provide protection against hazardous
materials and biological threats of varying degrees.

a) Beware that All blood, body fluids, secretions, non-intact skin, and mucous
membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents.
b) Always include a group of infection prevention practices that apply to all
patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any
healthcare delivery setting.
c) Universal precautions are designed to protect healthcare personnel.
d) Standard precautions are designed to protect the patient
2. Implementation:
- The extent of standard precautions used is determined by the anticipated
blood, body fluid, or pathogen exposure (Hand washing, Gloves, Gowns,
Masks, Protective eyewear).
3. Personal protective equipment (PPE):
a) PPE includes clothing or specialized equipment that provides some protection to the wearer from substances that may pose a health or safety risk.
b) Wear PPE appropriate for the potential hazard(s) (Steel-toe footwear, Helmets, Heat-resistant outwear, Self-contained breathing apparatus, Leather/
work gloves).

17

F- Multiple-patient situations:
1. Determine the number of patients and need for additional resources
b) How many patients?
c) Protection of the patient (Weather conditions, Unstable conditions).

EMT

PARAMEDIC

a) Does dispatch information suggest the need for additional resources?

d) Protection of bystanders (Isolate, Remove, Barricade).
2. Need for other additional resources
a) Incident Command System (ICS or IMS).
b) Consider what level of commitment is required for the situation.

Key Points:
• Interfacility Transfer: An interfacility transfer is defined as any EMS ambulance transport
from one healthcare facility to another. Examples include hospital-to-hospital,
hospital-to-rehabilitation, and hospital-to-long-term care.
• Nothing in this protocol shall preclude EMS personnel from providing any medication or
therapy that is already within their scope of practice unless it is explicitly forbidden by the
transferring facility provider’s written orders for transport.
• Unstable Patient: A critically ill or injured patient who cannot be stabilized at the
transporting facility, who is deteriorating or likely to deteriorate during transport.
• Potentially Unstable: A critically ill or injured patient who is currently stable (as defined
below) but whose disease process will likely lead to instability or an acute change in
condition enroute.
• Stable Patient: Hemodynamically stable patient with a secure airway and who is NOT in
acute distress or likely to deteriorate during transport.
• Resources: Could refer to personnel, equipment, medications or therapies.
• Sufficient & Appropriate: Transferring facilities are responsible for the coordination of
ongoing care during transfer until the patient arrives at the destination facility. Patient
must continue receiving care that is commensurate with their condition and potential for
deterioration throughout transfer within the limits of the system. This may mean providing
additional transferring facility or transporting agency personnel, up to and including
physicians if necessary.
• Non-complex vent settings: Volume or pressure modes of ventilation provided that:
- No inverse I:E ratios
- No PEEP > 20 cmH20
- No pediatric patients < 5 years of age
- No High frequency oscillation
- No Mode of ventilation without apnea backup
• Complex vent settings: Any mode of ventilation outside the above parameters.

Key Points:
• This is an extremely unstable period. The patient should be monitored closely and frequently.
Recurrent dysrhythmias, hypotension and re-arrest are not uncommon occurrences. Avoid
hyperthermia and hyperventilation.
• Avoid hyperoxygenation; oxygen administration should be titrated to patient condition, and
withheld unless evidence of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or an SpO2 less than 94%, especially in the
prescence of a suspected CVA/TIA or ACS.

Death Declaration Protocol

38

Code: R-3

Title: Death declaration protocol

START

The EMS Unit begins an emergency case and the EMS Unit checks for signs of life:

1 The EMS Unit begins an emergency case by checking for signs of life:
• Patient response.
• Pulse for 5-10 seconds.
• Breathing for 5-10 seconds.
• Eye pupils.
• Heart sounds by listening to the chest wall with a stethoscope.

In the absence of all five signs of life, the EMS Unit begins to search for signs of certain
death and injuries incompatible with life and asks about the presence of a written medical
decision not to resuscitate (DNR).
1- The EMS Unit starts high-quality CPR and transfers the case to the hospital

2 except in the following cases:

• There was an absence of the five signs of life combined in addition to one of the signs of
certain death.
• There was an absence of the five signs of life combined in addition to the presence of a
medical order (Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)) that is effective / valid / and after confirming
with the case’s relatives their desire not to resuscitate at this moment (now) - and in the
event of noticing any disagreement between the case’s relatives regarding the medical
order (Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)) and regardless of the age of the case (it is not necessary
to be an adult or a guardian), high-quality CPR is started and the case is transferred to the
hospital emergency room.
• There is a directive to use the Crisis Standards of Care and disasters
Where death can be declared on site and after contacting the medical control physician if
the following conditions are met:
First: The presence of the five signs together (1- Absence of response with 2- Absence of
pulse with 3- Absence of breathing with 4- Dilation and fixation of the pupils with 5Absence of heart sounds upon auscultation) with
Second: The presence of one of the following points:
• The presence of at least one of the clear signs of certain death, which are:
1. Livor Mortis
2. Rigor Mortis

39

3

3. Decay and signs of decomposition of body tissues
4. The presence of a clear fatal injury incompatible with life (massive crushing,
decapitation and separation of the head from the body, cutting the body in half,
crushing of the skull and exit of parts of the brain matter, complete charring of the body)
• In the event that there is only one EMS Unit at the site and there is more than one
injury, the Crisis Standards of Care are activated and the command and control room is
notified in the following two cases:
1- The presence of at least one red case at the site.
2- The presence of 6 or more injuries at the site and there is at least one yellow case.
(During the activation of the standards of care in crises, the medical control is not
contacted to declare death, but rather START triage is used)
The first EMS Unit (triage officer) requests a number of EMS Unit teams to support the
site, achieving the following:
- One EMS Unit for each case carrying a black card and no signs of certain death.
- At least one EMS Unit for each case carrying a red card in triage.
- One EMS Unit for every two cases at most, each carrying a yellow card.
- OneEMS Unit for every 5 cases, each carrying at least a green card.
• In the event that the number of supporting EMS Units on site is complete, the
ambulance teams begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation for:
• Cardiac and respiratory arrest cases carrying a black card and not showing any signs of
certain death.
As the triage officer team continues to re-sort, it must contact the medical control
physician to make death decisions on site for each:
1- Cardiac and respiratory arrest case carrying a black card with at least one sign of
certain death if it appears.
2- For each case that was given a black card instead of a red, yellow or green card and
showed at least one sign of certain death.
- High-quality resuscitation includes effective chest compressions, optimal use of
respiratory support devices, opening the airway, and the use of a defibrillator according
to the approved medical protocol in cases of cardiac and respiratory arrest, or the use of
the LUCAS device if available.

40

The following cases are exempt from the conditions for declaring death on site, even if
the professional judgment of the case indicates that the patient does not benefit from
resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be started immediately and
without the need to contact the medical control (the medical control is contacted to help
complete the resuscitation process and assist the EMS Unit from a scientific and
administrative coordination perspective, not to request a medical opinion regarding the
declaration of death or the start of resuscitation).
These exceptional cases are:
• In cases where the expected cause of cardiac and respiratory arrest is hypothermia.
• Expectation or occurrence of violent reactions by the patient's family members.
• In cases of pregnant women whose pregnancy is expected to be more than /20/ weeks,
where pregnant women who are suspected of having a fetus of a gestational age of
more than /20/ weeks are transferred to hospital emergency rooms regardless of the
number and type of certain signs of death and fatal injuries present - with or without
cardiopulmonary resuscitation according to the assessment of the EMS Unit or the
opinion of the medical control doctor - in order to save the fetus or confirm its death by
more specialized means in the hospital
• Patients who have ventricular assist devices.
• A special exceptional case (excluding part of the conditions for declaring death and
applying another part) is:
*Children aged / 5 / years or less, infants and newborns, where high-quality
cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated without the need to contact the medical
control physician unless they have ((1 - Decay and decomposition of body tissues - 2 Decapitation and separation of the head from the body - 3 - Cutting the body in half - 4
- Smashing the skull with part or all of the brain matter coming out of the head / It is
necessary to distinguish between the brain matter and the cerebrospinal fluid, which is
not considered a sign of death / - 5 - Complete charring of the body (not a third-degree
burn)), then the medical control physician is contacted to approve the death declaration.

41

- Livor Mortis: It is a change in the color of the skin to purple-red in the lower areas of the
body (provided that the patient/injured person is not moved frequently, as livor mortis
begins to appear after 20 minutes and up to three hours of stopping the heart and
breathing due to blood accumulation due to the effect of gravity, and it is a certain sign of
death that is not useful for cardiopulmonary resuscitation if it appears. It differs from
central cyanosis and peripheral cyanosis, which are considered signs of a critical condition
for the patient and not death.
- Rigor Mortis: It is a stiffness in the muscles due to chemical changes that occur two to four
hours after stopping the heart and breathing, which makes the body rigid and difficult to
move, and it is a sign of certain death that is not useful for cardiopulmonary resuscitation
if it appears.
- Rotting of the Corpse: The rotting of the corpse occurs due to the proliferation of
bacteria and fungi (as a result of the absence of the body's defenses) that are naturally
present inside the body after the leakage of cellular contents, which creates a suitable
environment for this reproduction and putrefaction begins with a change in the color of
the skin and swelling of parts of the body such as the face, abdomen, breasts, and scrotum.
The first sign of putrefaction appears after 18 hours of stopping the heart and breathing,
which is the green discoloration of the skin of the abdomen. There are other signs of
certain death (saponification and mummification), which are very late signs.
• The final decision to continue resuscitation or stop resuscitation efforts and declare
death is in the hands of the medical control physician on duty, based on the information
provided to him by the EMS Unit.
2-

In order to declare the death, the EMS Unit communicates with the medical control

doctor through the Authority’s approved means of communication and using video
communication if the medical control doctor requests this (the informant or the patient’s
first-degree relative must ask for permission before visual imaging).
5- In the event that an EMS Unit deals with a case of cardiac and respiratory arrest in a
health facility and there is a doctor next to the case who has declared the death - the EMS
Unit shall verify that the person announcing the death is a doctor (by reviewing the work
card), announce the death, document the name of the doctor announcing the death and

42

his place of work, obtain his signature on the e-PCR or medical report, and leave the site
without transferring the case unless it receives a directive from the directors or chief
paramedic or there are humanitarian circumstances that require cooperation to transfer
the case. The same decision shall be applied in the event that an EMS Unit deals with a
case of cardiac and respiratory arrest that was previously dealt with by the air ambulance
and the death was declared based on the opinion of the air ambulance doctor, after
reviewing the air ambulance team's medical report to verify this.

45

Key Points:
• For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with a BVM or
SGA. In some cases, intubation may be preferred. This is at the discretion of the treating
paramedic.
• The need for early defibrillation is clear and should have the highest priority. Since these
patients will all be in cardiopulmonary arrest, use of adjunctive equipment should not divert
attention or effort from Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) resuscitative measures, early
defibrillation and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS). Remember: rapid defibrillation
and high-quality CPR is the major determinant of survival.
• Early CPR and early defibrillation are the most effective therapies for cardiac arrest care.
• Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the blood pressure to
zero and stop perfusion to the heart and brain.
• Switch compressors at least every two minutes to minimize fatigue.
• Consider “hands on defibrillation.” (Compress when charging and resume compressions
immediately after the shock is delivered).
• Do not hyperventilate as it increases intrathoracic pressure and decreases blood return to the
heart. Ventilate at an appropriate rate, with enough volume to produce adequate chest rise.
Note: Reversible Causes of Cardiac Arrest include:
•

Hypothermia: initiate 2 large bore IVs (warm) normal saline

•

Hyperkalemia: Contact Medical Control

•

Hypoxia: provide high flow oxygen

•

Hypovolemia: 20ml/kg fluid bolus.

•

Hydrogen Ion/Acidosis: Contact Medical Control

•

Toxins/Tablets: see Toxicology protocol

•

Thrombus (Coronary/Pulmonary): Contact Medical Control

•

Tension Pneumothorax: Perform needle chest decompression.

Title: Newborn Resuscitation

START

Follow General Patient Care protocol go to G-1.
Follow last updated Saudi Heart Association (SHA) Guidelines, or as otherwise
noted in these protocols and other advisories.

Dry the infant, place on a dry blanket, cover the head and keep the infant warm.
EMT

PARAMEDIC

Maintain an open airway and suction the mouth, then nose. If meconium (brown
stained fluid) is present, suction the hypopharynx only if the infant is not vigorous
(Contact medical control immediately if available for possible need of endotracheal
intubation).

If ventilations are inadequate or chest fails to rise, reposition head and neck,
suction and initiate positive pressure ventilation at room air for term newborns or
for preterm (less than 38 weeks gestation) newborns at 40-60 breaths per minute,
as clinically indicated.
For heart rate less than 60, initiate positive pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen
for 1 minute and if heart rate remains at 60 start CPR at a 3:1 ratio (for a rate of 90
compressions/minute and 30 ventilations/minute).

If meconium is present, consider early endotracheal intubation and suctioning. (Note:
Do not suction or intubate a neonate with a vigorous cry).
For heart rate 60-80 and rapidly rising:
Continue manual ventilation at room air for term newborns or for preterm (less than 38
weeks gestation) newborns at 40-60 breaths per minute
Connect the newborn to Cardiac Monitor – Manage dysrhythmias per protocol
For heart rate less than 60:
Initiate CPR as indicated.
Initiate positive pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen for 1 minute and if heart rate
remains at 60, start chest compressions.
Continue manual ventilation with 100% oxygen after CPR is initiated.
Advanced airway management if not already done and perform capnography.
Connect the newborn to Cardiac Monitor. Manage dysrhythmias per protocol.
If defibrillation is indicated: initial energy level: 2 joules/kg subsequent: 4 joules/kg.
If synchronized cardioversion is indicated: 0.5-1 joules/kg
Establish IV or IO access, if indicated. (Note: appropriately trained and authorized Paramedics may utilize umbilical lines when necessary). Treat for shock with 10cc/kg of
Normal Saline over 5-10 minutes.
Medical Control may order:
Epinephrine 1:10,000 (0.01-0.03 mg/kg) IV/IO

Initial Evaluation of a Newborn
Three questions are part of every newborn baby’s initial evaluation, which is done
immediately after birth:
1. Is the baby looks term?
2. Does the baby cry or breathe?
3. Is the infant’s has good muscle tone?
•

If the response to each of these three questions is “yes,” the infant may remain with the

mother when the first procedures are carried out on her chest or abdomen. If any of the three
questions has a negative response, move on to the next step of the assessment.
Further Evaluation (Initial Steps) :
Provide Warmth, Dry, Stimulate, Open the Airway.
Remove the secretions if the infant is gasping or not breathing, if the airway is blocked, if the
baby is having trouble clearing their secretions, if PPV is predicted, or if they have weak
muscle tone. Routine suctioning is not advised if the baby is active
Assessing the Infant’s Reaction to The First Steps:
It shouldn’t take more than 30 seconds to monitor the newborn’s respirations to see if the baby is
responding to the first steps.
Is the Infant Gasping or Apneic?
Call for more assistance If the infant is not reacting to the first steps and is still not breathing, gasping for air, or has a heart rate of less than 100 bpm despite breathing, start the PPV right away.
Heart rate is measured by:
• The most accurate way to perform a physical examination is to use a stethoscope and listen
to the baby’s left side of the chest.
•To calculate the heart rate, multiply the number of beats in six seconds by ten.

50

Indications of Effective Positive Pressure Ventilation
Is your technique effective?
If Your Ventilation Technique Is Effective, three signs are observed:
1. An increase in heart rate
2. Chest is moving.
3. Increase in Oxygenation

The recommended breathing rate is 40 to 60 breaths per minute.
The infant should see an increase in heart rate within 15 seconds after beginning PPV.
If the baby’s heart rate does not increase and the chest does not move, you will need to make
a sequence of changes known as the ventilation corrective steps (MR.SOPA).

51

Key Points:
• The newly born should be evaluated for central cyanosis. Peripheral cyanosis is common and
may not be a reflection of inadequate oxygenation. If central cyanosis is present in a breathing newborn during stabilization, early administration of 100% oxygen is important while
the newborn is being assessed for need of additional resuscitative measures.

Airway Obstruction Protocol

54

Code: R-6

Title: Airway Obstruction Protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care protocol go to G-1.
Follow Saudi heart association (SHA) guidelines for foreign body obstruction.
Assess for airway obstruction severity: Mild: (Partial obstruction or effective cough)
or severe: (significant obstruction or ineffective cough.
If the obstruction due to a foreign body is complete or is partial with inadequate
air exchange, Go to Difficult Airway protocol P-2
Maintain an open airway, remove secretions (by gentle suction), vomitus and assist
ventilations as needed.
Transport the patient to appropriate medical facility if partial obstruction due to
foreign body is suspected and there is adequate air exchange.

EMT

PARAMEDIC

If the patient has tracheostomy tube, follow Tracheostomy Tube Obstruction Management Protocol P-16.
Provide airway management if indicated for mechanical obstruction if unable to
remove obstructing foreign body, continue BLS airway management by providing
positive pressure ventilations if needed.
Maintain an open airway, place child in position of comfort and avoid upper
airway stimulation if suspected croup (barking cough, no drooling) or epiglottitis
(stridor, drooling).
Nebulized racemic epinephrine 11.25 mg in 2.5ml Normal Saline, for suspected severe
croup, with stridor at rest and respiratory distress.
If complete airway obstruction, perform direct laryngoscopy if foreign body suspected.
If visualized and easily accessible, attempt removal with Magill Forceps.
If unable to remove obstructing foreign body, continue BLS airway management by
providing positive pressure ventilations.
If foreign body is removed, proceed with endotracheal intubation if necessary and
perform capnography.
In pediatrics, if unable to clear airway obstruction, unable to intubate as needed or unable
to perform positive pressure ventilations, perform a needle cricothyrotomy, if permitted.
Consult Medical Control.

Code: R-6

Title: Airway Obstruction Protocol

END

55

Key Points:
• For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with a BVM or
SGA.
In some cases, intubation may be preferred. This is at the discretion of the treating para•
medic.

syndrome protocol

57

Code: C-1

Title: Chest pain and acute coronary syndrome protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
Obtain 12-Lead ECG for all patients with chest pain, epigastric discomfort, or suspected
acute coronary syndrome before leaving the scene and transmit to medical director.

EMT

• Administer oxygen to patients with dyspnea, hypoxia (O2 saturation <94%), or
signs of heart failure at a rate to keep O2 sat ≥ 94%.
• Be cautious if the patient known to have COPD (target O2 saturation 88-92%).
Administer Aspirin 300 mg. Check allergy status.
Establish IV before administration of Nitroglycerin.

PARAMEDIC

Facilitate administration of patient's own Nitroglycerin.
•
Confirm absence of contraindications.
•
Must be patient’s own Nitroglycerin.
•
Include doses self-administered PTA (prior to arrival).
•
SBP must be >120mmHg.
Contact Medical Control for other treatment options.
Connect the patient to Cardiac Monitor.
If SBP >120 mmHg, administer one (1) Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL every 5 minutes until pain
relieved OR to a maximum of 3 doses; hold NTG if SBP <90 mmHg.
If pain unrelieved by NTG, administer Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg slow IV/IO weight based (kg) to
a max of 150mcg (150kg)
If pain unrelieved by NTG, and Fentanyl is not available administer Morphine Sulfate 4
mg IV initial dose, and administer 2 mg every 5 minutes until pain relieved OR to maximum dose of 10 mg; Hold Morphine if SBP <90 mmHg,
If systolic BP <90 mmHg– place patient in supine position with legs elevated (shock
position) & give 250 ml NS fluid bolus.
For nausea and vomiting go to M-8.
Contact Medical Control for Additional doses of above medications.
If patient appears to be having a ST-elevation MI (STEMI), refer to the appropriate
STEMI-Point of Entry (POE) plan, and transport accordingly. Follow bypass protocol go
to S-8.
Code: C-1

Title: Chest pain and acute coronary syndrome protocol

END

58

Key Points:
-Exclude other life-threatening causes of chest pain.
- contraindications of aspirin are:
•

Aspirin allergy or aspirin induced asthma.

•

Active GI bleeding.

•

If patient has taken 300 mg within the last 24 hours.

-Not all patients with complaints of chest pain should be treated with aspirin, nitrates and
oxygen. Consider the likelihood of ACS based on the nature of the symptoms, the patient’s
age, cardiac risk factors, past medical history, etc.
-Chest wall tenderness does not rule out cardiac ischemia.
-Have a high index of suspicion for cardiac disease in women, diabetics, and all patients >50
years old who have any symptoms might be attributed to acute coronary syndrome (e.g.
nausea, neck, jaw, or arm pain, chest pain, diaphoresis, syncope).
-Avoid nitroglycerin in ALL patients who have used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as
sildenafil (Viagra), Tadalafil (Cialis) within the last 48 hours. These medications are often
used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.
-Avoid hyperoxygenation, oxygen administration should be titrated to patient condition,
and administered with evidence of hypoxemia, dyspnea, or an SpO2< 94%.
-Avoid administration of nitrates to patients with inferior-wall STEMI or suspected right
ventricular (RV) involvement.
-All patients with ACS like symptoms of a non-traumatic etiology should be considered to be
of cardiac origin until proven otherwise.

5.

Remove the allergen if applicable.
Epinephrine for anaphylaxis must be administered by Auto-Injector or IM if trained and
authorized to do so in accordance with Medical director.
Epinephrine is associated with many adverse reactions including hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, tremor, anxiety, vomiting, and chest pain.
Epinephrine should be used with caution in the elderly, in patients with known heart disease,
and in patients with uncontrolled hypertension except in life-threatening allergic reactions
The two forms of Epinephrine must not be confused, or over-dosage may occur. The
1:1000 dilution is appropriate for intramuscular injection. The 1:10,000 dilution is for
intravenous injection, which require On-line medical direction. The 1:1,000 dilution is
NEVER given intravenously. An Epi Pen Auto Injector is approved for administration of

8.
9.

1:1,000 dose IM.
The use of Epinephrine in patients over the age of 40 or with known cardiac disease and
patients who have already taken high dosage of inhalant bronchodilator medications may
result in cardiac complications
Epinephrine for bronchospasm must be administered by Auto-Injector ONLY, except by
medical control order or department authorization.
Mild distress in children is evidenced by minor wheezing and good air entry.
Severe distress in children is evidenced by poor air entry, extreme use of accessory muscles,
nasal flaring, grunting, cyanosis and/or altered mental status (weak cry, somnolence, poor
responsiveness). REMEMBER: Severe bronchospasm may present without wheezes, if there
is minimal air movement.

10 Respiratory Distress is defined as inadequate breathing in terms of rate, rhythm, quality
and/or depth of breathing. Children who are breathing too fast or slow, or in an abnor-

mal pattern or manner, may not be receiving enough oxygen to support bodily functions
and may allow an increase in carbon dioxide to dangerous levels. Cyanosis is usually a late
sign and requires immediate treatment.

78

11. Criteria for epinephrine administration in pediatric:
• Age greater than or equal to 6 months, AND
• Known history of asthma or reactive airway disease or bronchospasm or bronchodilators
prescribed, AND
• Patient in respiratory arrest or approaching respiratory arrest (requiring BVM), AND
• Oxygen saturation less than 92% despite supplemental oxygen or unmeasurable.
Clinical Criteria for Anaphylaxis:
If one of these criteria is fulfilled, treat for anaphylaxis.

Code: M-3

Title: Behavioral Emergencies protocol START

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
Consider all possible medical/trauma causes for behavior (e.g., hypoglycemia,
overdose, substance abuse, hypoxia, seizure, head injury). Follow the appropriate
protocol as applicable.
One EMT should manage the patient while the other handles scene control, but no
EMT or First Responder should be left alone with the patient.
Avoid areas/patients with potential weapons (e.g., kitchen, workshop), and avoid
areas with only a single exit; do not allow patient to block exit.
Keep environment calm by reducing stimuli (may need to ask family/friends to
leave room, ask patient to turn off music/TV). Transport in a non-emergent mode
unless the patient’s condition requires lights and sirens.
Respect the dignity and privacy of the patient.
Make eye contact when speaking to the patient. Maintain eye-level if possible.
Maintain non-threatening body language (hands in front of your body, below your
chest, palms out and slightly to the sides).
EMT

PARAMEDIC

Speak calmly and in a non-judgmental manner; do not make sudden movements.

Establish expectations for acceptable behavior, if necessary.
Ask permission to touch the patient before taking vital signs, and explain what you
are doing.
Assess the patient to the extent that they allow without increasing agitation,
maintain a safe distance from a violent patient.
Stop talking with patient if they demonstrate increased agitation; allow time for
them to calm down before attempting to discuss options again.
Provide reassurance by acknowledging the crisis and validating the patient’s feelings and concerns; use positive feedback, not minimization.
Determine risk to self and others (“Are you thinking about hurting/killing yourself
or others?”).
Encourage patient to cooperatively accept transport to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and treatment.
Consider asking friends/relatives on scene to encourage patient to accept transport, if needed; but only if they are not a source of agitation.
Ask law enforcement or Online Medical Control to complete application for uncooperative patients who acknowledge intent to self-harm or harm others, but do
not delay transport in the absence of this document.

Use restraint if de-escalation strategy fails and the patient is a danger to him/herself or
others. Follow behavioral emergencies restraint protocol S-5
81

Initiate an IV of Normal Saline at a KVO rate.
Apply cardiac monitor if clinically feasible, obtain 12 lead ECG, and manage dysrhythmias per protocol.

PARAMEDIC

Position patient to ensure breathing is not impaired.
Administer:
Haloperidol 5 mg IM; and/or
Midazolam 2-6 mg IV/IM/IN. Use lower dose for IV route and higher dose for IM/IN
route.
Ketamine 4mg/kg IM only, to a maximum dose of 400mg IM only, as a single dose.
NOTE: In patients >70 years of age, limit medication to half these Doses
For pediatric patient, Administer Midazolam 0.1mg/kg IV/IM/IN, to maximum dose of 4 mg.
Medical Control may order additional doses of above medications

Code: M-5

Title: Hyperglycemia

START

Follow General Patient Care protocol, go to G-1.

EMT

PARAMEDIC

Check Blood Glucose.
Establish IV line.
Administer 1000 ml fluid bolus IV (0.9% Normal Saline).
Administer 10 mL/kg IV bolus of IV fluid (0.9% Normal Saline).
Provide oral hydration with water if the patient is not vomiting, and must be alert
enough to swallow and protect airway.
Contact online medical control for possible additional doses.
- May repeat 500 mL fluid bolus, as needed, in adults.
- May repeat fluid bolus two times for a total of 3 fluid boluses, not to exceed 20 mL/kg,
in pediatrics.
Code: M-5

Title: Hyperglycemia

END

Key Points:
• Check signs of volume overload before administering fluids since some patients have heart
failure or renal impairment, example: check for pitting edema and lung crepitation.
• Hyperglycemia is defined as blood glucose greater than or equal to 250 mg/dL. Patient with
associated signs and symptoms such as altered mental status, increased respiratory rate, or
dehydration may require treatment.
• Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening emergency defined as uncontrolled hyperglycemia with the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis.
• Signs and symptoms of DKA include uncontrolled blood glucose greater than or equal to
250 mg/dL, weakness, altered mental status, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria
(excessive urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), a fruity odor on the breath (from
ketones), and tachypnea (Kussmaul respirations).
• Common causes of DKA include infection, acute coronary syndrome, and medication noncompliance. Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Nonketotic Syndrome (HHNS) is characterized by
blood glucose levels greater than 600 mg/dL and profound dehydration without significant
ketoacidosis. Most patients present with severe dehydration and focal or global neurologic
deficits e.g., coma, altered mental status.
• Hyperglycemia may be detrimental to patients at risk for cerebral ischemia such as victims of
stroke, cardiac arrest, and head trauma.

speak and swallow, administer oral glucose or other sugar source as tolerated.
• Oral glucose: One dose is one tube. Other sugar sources are acceptable.
• A second dose may be necessary after 10 minutes if patient remains symptomatic
• If patient <20kg (44 lbs), oral glucose ½ tube PO
• If patient >20kg (44 lbs), oral glucose 1 tube PO
• A second dose may be necessary after 10 minutes if patient remains
symptomatic

For hypoglycemic emergency administer:
Dextrose 10% 100ml IV/IO. Recheck glucose 5 minutes after administration of dextrose.
May repeat Dextrose 10% up to 200ml IV/IO if glucose level is <70mg/dL with continued
altered mental status

status returns to baseline and glucose level is greater than 70 mg/dl.
If unable to establish IV access, administer Glucagon 1mg IM if available and prepare
for transportation to nearest facility.
o Recheck glucose 15 minutes after administration of glucagon.
Contact online medical direction if need for additional doses of above medications.
If cerebrovascular accident is suspected, follow M-15 stroke protocol and notify Medical
Control
Code: M-6

Title: Hypoglycemia protocol

END

91

Key Points:
*Hypoglycemic Emergency:
• Glucose <70mg/dL with associated altered mental status.
• Causes of hypoglycemia include medication misuse or overdose, missed meal, infection,
cardiovascular insults (e.g., myocardial infarction, arrhythmia), or changes in activity
(e.g., exercise).
• Sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide, glipizide) have long half-lives ranging from 12-60 hours.
Patients with corrected hypoglycemia who are taking these agents are at particular risk
for recurrent symptoms and frequently require hospital admission.
• Dextrose may be administered in any concentration (D10, D25, D50), as long as the
correct dose is given
• Intraosseous (IO) administration of dextrose should be reserved for hypoglycemic patients
with severe altered mental status or active seizures and IV access cannot be obtained.

END

94

KEY POINTS:
• Post-partum patients may experience eclamptic seizures up to several weeks after giving
birth.
• Suspect eclampsia if the patient is ≥20 weeks pregnant or ≤6 week's post-partum.
• Seizures may be caused by arrhythmias, particularly in patients over 50.
• Seizure activity may be caused by cerebral hypoxia from cardiac arrest, always check a pulse
when seizures terminate.
•Status epilepticus is defined as any generalized seizures lasting more than 5 minutes or 2 or
more episodes of seizure without regaining consciousness. This is a true emergency requiring
rapid airway control, treatment (including benzodiazepines), and transport.
• Seizures in pediatric patients are commonly febrile seizures and are usually benign and
short-lived.
• There is an increased risk of apnea with >2 doses of benzodiazepines.
• IM midazolam should be administered to the lateral thigh.
• Diazepam is not well absorbed IM and should be given IV.
• For IN administration of midazolam use a 5 mg/mL concentration.
• Magnesium can cause respiratory depression and hypotension.

Title: Obstetric emergencies protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
Follow local OB Diversion Protocols.
Establish IV access.
Fluids must not to exceed 2000 mL without consultation with Medical Control.
For third trimester bleeding:

• Suspect Placenta Previa (placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment).
• Suspect placental abruption (placenta is separated from the uterine wall before
delivery); because hemorrhage may occur into the pelvic cavity, shock can develop
despite relatively little vaginal bleeding.
• Do not perform digital examination.
• Place patient in the left lateral position.
• Monitor hemodynamic stability.

For breech birth (presentation of buttock):
• Do not pull on newborn. Support newborn and allow delivery to proceed normally.
• If the head is not delivered within 30 seconds of the legs, place two fingers into
the vagina to locate the infant’s mouth. Press the vaginal wall away from the
EMT

PARAMEDIC

• If the legs have delivered, gently elevate the trunk and legs to aid delivery of the head.

infant’s mouth to maintain the fetal airway.
For limb presentation:

• Place mother in knee-chest or Trendelenburg position.
• Do not attempt delivery; transport emergently as surgery is likely.
For prolapsed cord:

• Discourage pushing by the mother.
• Place mother in knee-chest or Trendelenburg position.
• If umbilical cord pulse is absent, place a gloved hand into the mother’s vagina and
decompress the umbilical cord by elevating the presenting fetal part off the cord.
• Wrap cord in warm, sterile saline soaked dressing.
For shoulder dystocia:

• Suspect if newborn’s head delivers normally and then retracts back into
perineum because shoulders are trapped.
• Discourage pushing by the mother.
• Support the baby’s head, do not pull on it.
• Suction the nasopharynx and oropharynx, as needed.
• Position mother with buttocks dropped off end of stretcher and thighs flexed
upward (Extreme knee-chest position/McRoberts's maneuver). Apply firm pressure
with an open hand immediately above pubic symphysis.
117

• If the above method is unsuccessful, consider rolling the patient to all fours position.
For postpartum hemorrhage:

• Vigorously massage fundus until uterus is firm.
• If possible, initiate breast-feeding.
• If blood loss is > 500 mL or patient is hemodynamically unstable, treat according
to Non-Traumatic Shock Protocol M-16

PARAMEDIC

EMT

For preterm labor:

20 mL/kg 0.9% NaCl, may repeat once
For cardiac arrest in the pregnant patient (regardless of etiology):
Go to Cardiac arrest protocol R-1, Neonatal resuscitation protocol R-5.
For patient ≥ 20-week gestation or if the fundus is palpable at or above the level
of the umbilicus, apply left lateral uterine displacement (LUD) with the patient in
the supine position to decrease aortocaval compression. LUD should be
maintained during CPR. If ROSC is achieved, the patient should be placed in the
left lateral decubitus position.
Pre-eclampsia / Eclampsia:

• Ensure quiet environment / dim lights / limited use of siren.
• Place patient in left lateral recumbent position.
• Establish IV access.
For patients in the third trimester of pregnancy or post-partum who are seizing, postictal
or have symptoms of severe preeclampsia (SBP> 160 or DBP>110, new onset confusion,
severe headache, visual disturbances, severe & persistent RUQ pain or pulmonary edema):
Administer magnesium sulfate, 4 grams IV (mix in 100 mL 0.9% NaCl) bolus over 10
minutes, and then consider 1 gram/hr continuous infusion.

Key Points:
1. The amount of bleeding is difficult to estimate. Menstrual pad holds between 5 - 15 mL
depending on type of pad. Maternity pad holds 100 mL when completely saturated. Chux pad
holds 500 mL. Estimate the amount of bleeding by number of saturated pads in last 6 hours.
Consider transporting the soiled linen to the hospital to help estimate blood loss.
2. Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia is most commonly seen in the last 10 weeks of gestation, during labor,
or up to 48 hours post-partum. It also may occur up to several weeks post-partum.
3. Recognition:

• 3rd trimester bleeding: vaginal bleeding occurring ≥ 28 weeks of gestation.
• Preterm labor: onset of labor/contractions prior to the 37th week of gestation.
• Malpresentation: presentation of the fetal buttocks or limbs.
• Prolapsed umbilical cord: umbilical cord precedes the fetus.
• Shoulder dystocia: failure of the fetal shoulder to deliver shortly after delivery of the head.
• Postpartum hemorrhage: Active bleeding after uterine message and oxytocin administration.
• Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia: BP> 160/100, severe headache, visual disturbances, edema, RUQ pain, seizures.

Suspected respiratory infectious
diseases protocol

120

Code: M-14

Title: Suspected respiratory infectious diseases protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
Put on appropriate PPE before entering the scene. Follow body surface isolation protocol G-2
Initial assessment should begin from a distance of at least 6 feet from the patient, if
possible.
Patient contact should be minimized to the extent possible until a facemask is on the
patient.
If COVID-19 is suspected, all PPE, as described below, should be used. If COVID-19 is not
suspected, EMS clinicians should follow standard procedures and use appropriate PPE for
evaluating a patient with a potential respiratory infection.
A facemask should be worn by the patient for source control. If a nasal cannula is in
place, a facemask should be worn over the nasal cannula. Alternatively, an oxygen mask
can be used if clinically indicated.
During transport, limit the number of providers in the patient compartment to essential

PARAMEDIC

personnel to minimize possible exposures.
Consult with medical control before performing aerosol-generating procedures for
specific guidance.
An N-95 or higher-level respirator, instead of a facemask, should be worn in addition to
the other PPE described above, for EMS providers present for or performing aerosol-generating procedures.
EMS providers should exercise caution if an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g., bag
valve mask [BVM] ventilation, oropharyngeal suctioning, endotracheal intubation, nebulizer treatment, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], bi-phasic positive airway
pressure [BiPAP], or resuscitation involving emergency intubation or cardiopulmonary
resuscitation [CPR]) is necessary.
If possible, the rear doors of the transport vehicle should be opened (after stopping the
vehicle), and the HVAC system (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) activated
during aerosol-generating procedures. This should be done away from pedestrian traffic.
EMS providers should notify the receiving health care facility the patient has an exposure
history and signs and symptoms suggestive of contagious disease so that appropriate
infection control precautions can be taken prior to patient arrival.
Keep the patient separated from other people as much as possible.
Family members and other contacts of patients with possible COVID-19 should not ride in
the transport vehicle, if possible. If riding in the transport vehicle, they should wear a
cloth face covering.

121

Isolate the ambulance driver from the patient compartment and keep pass-through
doors and windows tightly shut. When possible, use vehicles that have isolated driver
and patient compartments that can provide separate ventilation to each area.
During transport, vehicle ventilation in both compartments should be on non-recirculated
mode to maximize air changes that reduce potentially infectious particles in the vehicle.
If the vehicle has a rear exhaust fan, use it to draw air away from the cab, toward the
patient-care area, and out the back end of the vehicle.
If a vehicle without an isolated driver compartment and ventilation must be used, open
PARAMEDIC

the outside air vents in the driver area and turn on the rear exhaust ventilation fans to
the highest setting. This will create a negative pressure gradient in the patient area.
Follow routine procedures for a transfer of the patient to the receiving health care facility (e.g., wheel the patient directly into an examination room).
Documentation of patient care should be done after EMS providers have completed
transport, removed their PPE, and performed hand hygiene.
If the case is not suspected as contagious disease, follow the appropriate protocol.

Code: M-18

Title: Brief Resolved Unexplained Event protocol (BRUE)

END

134

Key Points:
-

Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE):

An event involves a frightening episode occurring in an infant < 1 year old when

the observer reports a sudden, brief and now resolved episode of 1 or more of the
following:

• Cyanosis or pallor
• Absent, decreased or irregular breathing
• Marked change in tone (hyper or hypotonia)
• Choking
• Altered level of responsiveness.
-

BRUE is not a disease, but a constellation of symptoms. Potential etiologies include central
apnea (immature respiratory center), obstructive apnea (structural), gastroesophageal
reflux (laryngospasm, choking, gagging), respiratory (pertussis, RSV), cardiac (congenital
heart disease, arrhythmia), seizures.

-

Always consider non-accidental trauma in any infant who presents with BRUE.

-

Although children who experience BRUE have a normal physical exam upon assessment by
prehospital personnel, they should be transported to the emergency department for
further assessment and treatment as they often have a serious underlying condition.
Assume history provided by the family/witness is accurate.

All near-drowning patients should be transported rapidly.
Establish IV line normal saline KVO.
Attach cardiac monitor, perform 12-Lead ECG.
Evaluate the need for advanced airway. (1)
Monitor closely for pulmonary edema.
Consider early intubation for unconscious patients in distress.
Contact Medical Control before withholding or terminating resuscitation efforts.
Code: E-1

Title: Drowning protocol

END

138

KEY POINTS :
-

Coldwater offers enhanced survival only where the patient becomes cold before cardiac
arrest.

-

There is no need to clear the airway of aspirated water; only a modest amount of water is
aspirated by most drowning victims, and aspirated water is rapidly absorbed into the
central circulation.

-

Unnecessary cervical spine immobilization can impede the adequate opening of the
airway and delay the delivery of rescue breaths.

-

Patients are in the water with the head above water and they continue to breathe while
they cool down before they eventually arrest. Prognosis can be good with patients surviving after prolonged CPR.

-

Children may survive despite A clear history of prolonged submersion.

-

Conscious patients who survive any form of drowning are at risk of deterioration and
should be transported to the hospital.

Key Points:
• Gather as much information on the animal as possible.
• Do not use tourniquets, electric shock, or alcohol.
• Do not incise the site of sting.
• Do NOT apply ice or cold packs to snake bites or marine stings.
• Bites from coral snakes, elapids related to cobras, usually do not present with early symptoms. All bites are considered envenomated.
• Human bites have higher infection rates than animal bites due to normal mouth bacteria.
• Cat bites may progress to infection rapidly due to specific bacteria in their mouths.
• Carnivore bites (such as dogs) have potential for progression to infection and risk of Rabies
exposure.

KEY POINTS:
1) Definitions:
• Heat cramps: are painful, involuntary muscle spasms that usually occur during heavy exercise in
hot environments. The spasms may be more intense and more prolonged than are typical nighttime leg cramps. Fluid and electrolyte loss often contribute to heat cramps. Muscles most often
affected include those of calves, arms, abdominal wall and back, although heat cramps may involve
any muscle group involved in exercise.
• Heat exhaustion: is a condition whose symptoms may include heavy sweating and a rapid pulse, a
result of body overheating. It's one of three heat-related syndromes, with heat cramps being the
mildest and heatstroke being the most severe. Causes of heat exhaustion include exposure to high
temperatures, particularly when combined with high humidity, and strenuous physical activity.
Without prompt treatment, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life-threatening condition.
Fortunately, heat exhaustion is preventable.
• Heatstroke: is a condition caused by body overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure
to or physical exertion in high temperatures. This most serious form of heat injury, heatstroke, can
occur if your body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher. The condition is most common in the
summer months. Heatstroke requires emergency treatment. Untreated heatstroke can quickly
damage your brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. The damage worsens the longer treatment is
delayed, increasing your risk of serious complications or death.
2) Persons at great risk of hyperthermia are infants, elderly, individuals in athletic endurance
events, and persons taking medications that impair the body’s ability to regulate heat (e.g. many
psychiatric medications, diuretics, alcohol).
3) Heat exhaustion may progress to heat stroke without obvious external signs/symptoms.
4) Heat stroke is associated with altered mental status and temperature > 41.1 degrees (Celsius 106
degrees Fahrenheit)

Title: Electrical and lightening Injuries protocol

END

157

KEY POINTS:
The same basic scientific principles of electricity apply to lightning.
-Lightning may strike a person directly or indirectly. A person’s chances of being struck are
increased by wearing or carrying metal objects (such as golf clubs or umbrellas) or other
conductors. Current from lightning may reach the body indirectly by traveling through a tree
or other object (contact voltage) .
- Most electrical and lightening injuries result in skin burns.
- The most severe effects of lightning strike are cardiac and respiratory arrest.

Tips to Avoid Lightning Strike :
• Seek shelter inside an enclosed building or metal-topped automobile.
• Avoid large flat, open areas or hilltops.
• Avoid contact with metal objects and remove metal objects, such as jewelry or hairpins.
• Avoid trees, boats, and open water.
• If caught on open ground, curl up on your side with hands and feet close together to
reduce contact points, or squat with feet together. If possible, place a rubber raincoat under
your body or feet to reduce ground current effects.
• If in a forest, seek shelter under a thick growth of shorter trees.
• If indoors, avoid the use of wired phones and contact with plumbing or
electrical appliances.

Title: Hypothermia protocol

END

Key Points:
• Apparent rigor mortis, dependent lividity or fixed and dilated pupils are NOT a contraindication for CPR in hypothermia
• AED/defibrillate, if indicated, once per cycle of CPR up to three times. Consider limiting
further defibrillation attempts until core temperature known to be > 30°C (86°F).
• Hypothermic patients without contraindications to CPR should have continuous CPR and
should not be considered for Termination of Resuscitation until the core temperature is
above 32°C (90°F) without ROSC
• When feasible, patients in severe or profound hypothermia with or without continuing
CPR should be transported directly to a center capable of providing cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Consider air medical transport.
• If pulse and breathing are absent and esophageal or rectal temperature core temperature
is < 32°C (89.6°F): - Continue CPR.

Rule of Nines

165

Key Points:
• The following injuries generally require referral to a burn unit:
1. Partial thickness burns greater than 10% total body surface area (TBSA)
2. Burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints
3. Third-degree burns in any age group
4. Electrical burns, including lightning injury
5. Chemical burns
6. Inhalation injury
7. Burn injury in patients with preexisting medical disorders that could complicate management,
prolong recovery, or affect mortality. Burns in any patients with concomitant trauma (such as
fractures) in which the burn injury poses the greatest risk of morbidity or mortality. In such cases, if
the trauma poses a greater immediate risk than the burns, it may be necessary to stabilize the
patient in a trauma center before being transferred to a burn unit.
• Prolonged cooling may result in hypothermia
• Inhalation injuries are burn injuries and may cause delayed, but severe airway compromise.
• Pulse oximeter gives false high reading in presence of carbon monoxide poisoning or cyanide
poisoning
• Consider the possibility of abuse when certain burns are encountered. These include cigarette
burns, iron burns, grill burns, and any burns in the elderly or children where the described mechanism of injury appears to be unlikely
• Smoke is a combination of many dangerous toxins produced by incomplete combustion. Patients
exposed to smoke should be considered for carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN)
poisoning.

old exhibiting signs of tentorial herniation (Decreasing LOC, pupil inequality,
Contralateral hemiparesis and decerebrate posturing) or Cushing’s Reflex
(Hypertension, bradycardia and irregular respirations): 3mL/kg (to max 250mL) 3%
saline over 20 minutes

176

If the patient has nausea or vomiting administer Ondansetron 0.15mg/kg IV or
metoclopramide 0.1 to 0.15mg/kg iv slowly for age 1 to 18 years.
Check vital signs after administering any medication.
Reassess airway, breathing or circulation if the patient deteriorates.

PARAMEDIC

If intubated, maintain ETCO2 at 35-40 mmHg.
Sedate the patient if he/she is combative and may cause further harm to self and others
Administer Midazolam 2.5 mg IV/IN may repeat once in 5 minutes or; 5 mg IM may repeat
once in 10 minutes OR Administer Diazepam 2 mg IV; may repeat once in 5 minutes
Administer fluid bolus 20 mL/kg; may repeat x2 (maximum total 60 ml/kg) to improve
clinical condition (capillary refill time ≤ 2 seconds, equal peripheral and distal pulses,
improved mental status, normal breathing).

Administer Midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV/IM or 0.1 mg/kg IN (maximum dose 3 mg); may
repeat once in 5 minutes OR Administer Diazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum dose 5 mg); may
repeat once in 5 minutes
Code: T-3

Title: Head Injuries protocol

END

KEY POINTS:
Brain Injury as a result of head trauma occurs by both:
1. Primary “impact” damage as the immediate consequence of the injury; and
2. Secondary complications of impact such as blood accumulation or cerebral swelling, sometimes
with herniation syndromes.
GCS is the most reliable indicator of brain injury in the field:
GCS 13-15 Minor TBI (traumatic brain injury)
GCS 9-12 Moderate TBI
GCS 3-8 Severe TBI
• Progressively increasing ICP (increased intracranial pressure) can lead to tentorial herniation. This
condition is manifested by a decreasing level of consciousness, ipsilateral pupil dilation, contralateral hemiparesis, and decerebrate posturing
• Cushing’s Reflex (bradycardia, irregular respirations, and hypertension) is a late clinical indication
of herniation.
• Head injury does not cause shock in adults. If shock is present in an adult patient with head
trauma, consider that there is probably another cause of shock.
• Head injury can cause shock in infants.

Code: T-4

Title: Amputations protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care protocol go to G-1
Control bleeding using direct pressure and elevation
Using a tourniquet: should be applied as close as practical to the injury site ONLY IF
bleeding cannot be controlled using direct pressure and elevation. The tourniquet
should not be covered. Note on the patient the time of tourniquet application and
document in the record.
Establish IV Normal Saline KVO.
Stump: Control bleeding and cover with sterile dressing
Amputated Part: Wrap in sterile dressing moistened with sterile saline and place in
a plastic bag, place the bag in ice water (use ice packs to provide some level of
extremity directly on ice or in water.
EMT

PARAMEDIC

cooling) Transport the part with the patient if possible. DO NOT place amputated
If the patient is trapped and extrication time will be prolonged, consider sending
the amputated part ahead to be surgically prepared for reimplantation.
For Partial Amputation: Control bleeding. Saturate wound with sterile saline and
cover with dry sterile dressing, splint in anatomical position and elevate the part.
Note Time and mechanism of amputation and Amount of blood loss
Do not apply tourniquet over joints.
Do Not Delay Transport.
Reassess for re-bleeding frequently, especially after any patient movement.
Transport to a hospital with reimplantation capability.
If shock syndrome present, proceed to Traumatic Shock Protocol (T-12).
Connect the patient to cardiac monitor.
Use a Hemostatic Agent If the tourniquet does not control the bleeding.
Consider Tranexamic Acid If bleeding is severe.
Manage the pain. Go to M-1 for Pain management protocol
Tranexamic Acid: Adult >18 years old: 2 g over 20 mins, MAX 100mg per min. Mix
2g in 100 mL (NS, D5W, or LR) and administer by IV flow regulator or pump
infusion (300mL/hr) over 20 mins
Check vital signs after Administration any medication.
Contact Medical Control if additional doses of above.
Code: T-4

Title: Amputations protocol

END

180

KEY POINTS:
• Do not immerse the amputated part directly in liquid or dry ice.
• Time is of the greatest importance to assure viability. If the extrication time will be prolonged,
consider sending the amputated part ahead to be surgically prepared for reimplantation.
• Tranexamic Acid Not Indicated for Pediatric and is contraindicated after 3 hours of bleeding.

Code: T-5

Title: Traumatic Cardiac Arrest

START

Follow general patient care protocol, go to G-1 with focus on continuous manual
chest compressions and AED use.
Treat according to appropriate Cardiac Arrest Protocol, go to R-1, R-4, and R-5.
Attempt to maintain spinal motion restriction by minimizing head movement. Do
not apply a cervical collar before ROSC
Provide early airway intervention using oral and/or nasal airways and suction. See
Airway management protocol P-1.
Consider placing a supraglottic airway device, follow supraglottic airway protocol-20.
Control hemorrhage, follow Bleeding control protocol T-6.

EMT

PARAMEDIC

Provide appropriate management for identified injuries:
-

Spinal injurie protocol, follow T-2

-

Head injuries protocol, go to T-3

-

Thoracic injuries protocol, go to T-7

Obtain 1-2 points of vascular access (IV, IO) while en route to the hospital, without
interrupting chest compressions.
Administer 1000 mL of IV fluid, repeat as needed.
Administer fluid bolus 20mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl by syringe method (may repeat to a
maximum 60 mL/kg) to improve clinical condition (capillary refill time ≤ 2 seconds,
equal peripheral and distal pulses, improved mental status, normal breathing).
If ROSC occurs, follow Post arrest care protocol R-2 and transport to a Level I or
Level II trauma center.
Consider not initiating resuscitation or early termination of efforts if there are
obvious signs of death, injuries that are not compatible with life, or if there has
been a prolonged downtime.
Consider early placement of an endotracheal tube without interrupting chest compression. Follow Airway Management & Difficult Airway Protocols, P-1, P-2.
Perform bilateral needle chest decompression. If indicated, go to P-9

Code: T-5

Title: Traumatic Cardiac Arrest

END

183

Key Points:
• Epinephrine and antidysrhythmics are not recommended in traumatic cardiac arrest.
For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with a BVM. In
• some cases, intubation may be preferred. This is at the discretion of the treating paramedic.
• Always remember that a medical cardiac arrest can lead to trauma. For example, a cardiac
arrest while driving causing a crash

Code: T-6

Title: Bleeding Control protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol, go to G-1.
Apply direct pressure/pressure dressing to injury (including use of a mechanical
pressure dressing [e.g. IT clamp]).
If direct pressure is ineffective or impractical:
If the wound is amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g. extremity injury), apply a
hemostatic tourniquet.
• Apply directly to the skin 2-3 inches above the bleeding site. If bleeding is not
controlled with the first tourniquet, apply a second tourniquet side-by-side with
the first.
• Document time of tourniquet application and communicate this clearly with
If the wound is not amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g. junctional injury),
EMT

PARAMEDIC

receiving facility.
Apply regular or pressure gauze with direct pressure. If available, apply hemostatic
agent (combat gauze), with direct pressure.
For junctional hemorrhage:
If available, consider use of a junctional tourniquet.
For hemorrhage originating from a dialysis shunt/fistula:
Apply firm finger tip pressure to bleeding site.
Apply a pressure dressing (avoid bulky dressing; dressing should not compress the
entire shunt/fistula for risk of clotting).
If direct pressure and dressing are not effective, (i.e. significant hemorrhage
continues): Apply a tourniquet to the affected extremity. The tourniquet should be
applied as remotely from the location of the shunt/fistula as possible.
Consult Medical Control, if tourniquet application is not according the above
mentioned standard.
If tourniquet has been in place for greater than 6 hours, do not remove.
If less than 6 hours consider Tourniquet Reassessment and Tourniquet Conversion
Algorithms.
Administer fluids for shock, Follow traumatic shock protocol T-12.
Assess pain level and consider pain control measures, Follow pain management
protocol M-1.
Code: T-6

Title: Bleeding Control protocol

END

186

KEY POINTS:
-

In the event of diminished scene safety (indirect threat, warm zone etc.), limb tourniquets

should be placed as high on the limb as possible and over clothing.
-

In the absence of a commercial tourniquet (preferred), an improvised device e.g., cravat

with windlass, blood pressure cuff could be used. The device must be a minimum of 2 inches wide,
otherwise it can cut through the skin.
-

Tourniquets applied prior to EMS arrival should be evaluated for effectiveness and appropri-

ateness. If tourniquet can be safely removed, remove the tourniquet, and apply pressure dressing.
-

Do not apply tourniquet over joints.

-

Reassess for re-bleeding frequently, especially after any patient movement.

-

Delay in placement of a tourniquet for life threatening hemorrhage significantly increases

mortality. Do not wait for hemodynamic compromise to apply a tourniquet.
-

If feasible, transport patients directly to trauma center and provide earliest possible notifica-

tion / trauma alert.
-

Damage to the limb from tourniquet application is unlikely if removed in several hours.

bag, distended neck veins, unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds, tracheal
deviation away from the side without breath sounds.)
• Immediately relieve tension by inserting a large bore needle in the mid-clavicular
line in the second intercostal space. Use needle chest decompression if indicated.
Go to Needle thoracostomy protocol P-9
• If present following closure of open pneumothorax, release occlusive dressing
temporarily.

Flail chest: (paradoxical movement of portion of chest wall)
-Position patient with injured side down, unless contraindicated.
-Provide manual stabilization of the flail segment.
Impaled Objects :

193

References:
• If no palpable, distal pulse is present following suspected extremity fracture, position injured
extremity in correct anatomic position, and apply gentle traction along the axis of the extremity
distal to the injury until the distal pulse is palpable and immobilize in place. Note: This does not
apply to dislocations.
• For dislocations due to direct impact, such as falls, the injury is more likely to be complicated
by a fracture. Reducing these involves more risk. Splinting in place and urgent evacuation is
ideal.
• Use ample padding when splinting possible fractures, dislocations, sprains, and strains. Elevate
injured extremities, if possible. Consider the application of a cold pack for 30 minutes.
• Musculoskeletal injuries can occur from blunt and penetrating trauma. Fractures of the
humerus, pelvis and femur, as well as fractures or dislocations involving circulatory or neurological deficits, take priority over other musculoskeletal injuries.
• Hip dislocations, pelvic, knee, and elbow fracture / dislocations have a high incidence of vascular compromise.
• Lacerations should be evaluated for repair within 6 - 12 hours.
• Blood loss may be concealed or not apparent with extremity injuries.

Code: P-3

Title: Mechanical CPR devices protocol

END

222

KEY POINTS:

• This protocol to establish standards for the use of a chest compression and cardiac catheterization lab capable mechanical CPR device. In each step of application, minimizing interruptions in compressions is paramount.
• All therapies related to the management of cardiopulmonary arrest should be continued as
currently defined.
• Initiate resuscitative measures following protocol – Do not delay manual CPR for the device.
Continue manual CPR until the device can be placed.
• Lucas device:
-

Defibrillation can and should be performed with the LUCAS device in place and in operation

-

One may apply the defibrillation electrodes either before or after the LUCAS device has
been put in position.

-

The pads and wires should not be underneath the suction cup

-

If the electrodes are already in an incorrect position when the LUCAS is placed, you must
apply new electrodes.

-

If the rhythm strip cannot be assessed during compressions, one may stop the compressions for analysis by pushing the PAUSE BUTTON (The duration of interruption of compressions should be kept as short as possible and should not be > 10 seconds. There is no need
to interrupt chest compressions other than to analyze the rhythm).

-

Once the rhythm is determined to require defibrillation, the appropriate ACTIVE BUTTON
should be pushed to resume compressions while the defibrillator is charging and then the
defibrillator should be discharged.

• NOTE: Do not stop the device for more than 10 seconds after at least 2 minutes of compressions per American Heart Association’s (AHA) CPR guidelines. Intravenous cannulation, endotracheal intubation, or any other procedure should either be attempted during chest compressions or during the 10 second pause. Approved alternatives to those procedures, such as
intraosseous infusion and a BLS airway (example: Supraglottic airway device) should be considered. Cardiac defibrillation should be attempted during a 10 second pause.

Title: High Quality CPR protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
Follow current Saudi Heart Association recommendations for cardiac arrest
management, follow cardiac arrest protocol as appropriate go to R-1 or R-4 or R-5.
Perform Immediate chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute.
Do compression depth of at least 5 cm (2 inch) in adults, and at least 1/3 the A/P
dimension of the chest in infants and children.
Allow complete chest recoil after each compression.
Use AED as soon as possible with minimal interruption of chest compressions.
Continue 2-minute cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions followed by AED

EMT

analysis and shock for 3 cycles (6 minutes)
If properly trained, use mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation device.
Place an oral or nasal airway.
If properly trained, insert a supraglottic airway device, see SGA protocol

PARAMEDIC

Ventilation / oxygenation options during 3 cycles (6 minutes):
•

BVM ventilation during recoil and without interrupting compressions, OR

•

If part of a care bundle, apply high flow oxygen via NRB

After 3 cycles (6 MINUTES):
•

Continue 2-minute cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions

•

If passive insufflation was used, switch to BVM ventilation.

Avoid excessive ventilation.
Switch compressors at least every two minutes to minimize fatigue.
Perform chest compressions while defibrillator is charging and resume compressions
immediately after the shock delivered.
Place IV/ IO without interrupting chest compressions
If utilizing a BVM, monitor quantitative waveform capnography throughout resuscitation
to assess CPR quality and to monitor for signs of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
Provide manual defibrillation as indicated after each 2-minute cycle.
After 4 cycles (8 minutes):
Consider endotracheal intubation or use an alternative airway without interrupting chest
compressions.
If authorized and trained Paramedics may use mechanical ventilators in rate control
mode with the following settings:
• Rate of 8-12 breaths per minute

226

PARAMEDIC

• Tidal volume 300-500mL
• Start at FiO2 1.0 (100%) then titrate to maintain SpO2 > 94% (88-92% for COPD
patients)
• Relief pressure 45-60 cmH2O
Consider mechanical ventilator following the initiation of respiratory component at
least 8 minutes after start of resuscitation even if ROSC has occurred
Code: P-4

Title: High Quality CPR protocol

END

KEY POINTS:
• Only for arrests of Cardiac etiology:
o Perform 2 minutes cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions
o Interrupt chest compressions only after each 2-minute cycle for 10 seconds only.
o Follow current SHA recommendations for cardiac arrest management.
• For primary respiratory etiology, ventilate immediately as part of CPR.
• It is expected, unless special circumstances are present, initial 6 minutes of resuscitation will be
performed on scene.
•

Early CPR and defibrillation are the most effective therapies for cardiac arrest care.

•

Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the blood pressure to

zero and stop perfusion to the heart and brain.
•

Recognizing the goal of immediate uninterrupted chest compressions, consider delaying

application of mechanical CPR devices until after the first three cycles (6 minutes). If applied during
the first 3 cycles, the goal is to limit interruptions. Mechanical devices should only be used by
services that are practiced and skilled at their application.

Urethral Catheterization protocol

229

Code: P-5

Title: Urethral Catheterization protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
Indications:

• Urinary retention
Contraindications:
• Inability to observe aseptic technique
• Structural abnormality in the urethra or urinary tract
• Trauma patient with suspected urethral injury as evidenced by:
-

Blood at the urethral meatus

-

High-riding prostate on rectal examination

-

Penile, scrotal, perineal hematoma

-

Postoperative urological patients.

PARAMEDIC

Considerations:
• Verify that the patient is not allergic to latex, iodine, or betadine. A silicone catheter
should be used if sensitivity exists. Hibiclens may be used as an alternative to iodine or
betadine.
• If patient discomfort noted with inflation of balloon, consider the catheter to be in the
urethra. Deflate the balloon and advance the catheter.
• If catheter insertion is in question (no urine return or unable to fully insert the catheter
in males), do not inflate the balloon.
• If resistance is met do not attempt forceful catheter insertion; apply continuous gentle
pressure while instructing the patient to void to open the sphincter.
Preparation:
• Select the smallest appropriate sized urethral catheter for insertion. Size 12–14F is
usually adequate for males and females.
• If genitalia visibly soiled, clean are using non-sterile gloves. Remove gloves and sanitize
hands with a hand sanitizing solution.
• Don protective eyewear.
• Using aseptic technique, open the outer plastic wrap to form a sterile field and place
the under pad beneath the patient, plastic side down.
• Apply sterile gloves; observe strict sterile technique until completion of procedure, and
inspect the catheterization kit to ensure its contents are complete and free of defects.
• Position the sterile drape around the patient’s genitals and clean the periurethral region.

230

• Before insertion, dispense the lubricating gel into the kit tray, pour cleansing solution
over three cotton balls, and remove the plastic sleeve for the catheter, and, if applicable, lock the sterile water syringe into the port.
• Using the dominant hand, cover 2-5 cm of the tip of the catheter with lubricant
• Use a copious intraurethral lubrication including a topical anesthetic (2% lidocaine jelly).
Technique:
• Female Catheter Insertion:
-

Position the patient in the supine position with legs apart and feet together, the
lower extremities are frog-legged to maximize exposure of the periurethral region,
and Adequate lighting is essential.

-

Separate the labia using the non-dominant hand to facilitate cleansing the periure-

PARAMEDIC

thral region and viewing the urethral meatus. The gloved dominant hand is used to
place the catheter into the urethral meatus and steady gentle pressure used to
advance the catheter.
-

Use sterile forceps to grasp one cotton ball, wipe one side of the labia from top to
bottom, and discard the cotton ball away from the sterile field.

-

Repeat on the opposite side and then wipe down the middle using the third cotton
ball. Wipe the area dry with the dry cotton balls.

-

Insert the catheter approximately three inches, wait for return of urine, and then
advance another 1 inch.

-

The catheter should be inserted to the flared portion of the catheter.

-

Inflate catheter balloon slowly with sterile water.

-

For the unconscious female or those with decreased sensation, insert the catheter
slightly further than 3 inches to ensure placement is in the bladder.

• Male Catheter Insertion:
-

Position into a supine position.

-

Retract the foreskin, if present, and hold the shaft of the penis firmly with the
non-dominant hand, and apply tension directed toward the ceiling, straightening
the urethra.

-

The gloved dominant hand is used to place the catheter into the urethral meatus
and steady gentle pressure used to advance the catheter. When a coudé catheter is
used, the curved tip of the catheter should be oriented toward the dorsal surface of
the penis.

231

-

Use sterile forceps to grasp one cotton ball, wipe the glans from the meatus outward
using a circular motion, and then discard the cotton ball away from the sterile field.

-

Repeat with two more cotton balls. Wipe the area dry with the dry cotton balls.

-

Grasp the penis in an upright position and insert the lubricated catheter to the bifurcation of the catheter.

-

When the catheter tip approaches the external sphincter in men, resistance will be
felt. It is often helpful to pause momentarily to let the sphincter relax before continu-

PARAMEDIC

ing insertion.
-

The catheter should be inserted to the flared portion of the catheter.

-

Inflate the balloon slowly with sterile water. Withdraw the catheter slowly to the
point of resistance at the bladder neck.

• The balloon is inflated with sterile water only after the flow of urine is seen. Saline
should not be used to inflate the balloon, because crystal formation may obstruct the
balloon channel and prevent balloon deflation.
• Once the balloon is inflated, the catheter is withdrawn until slight resistance is felt.
• Connect catheter to a drainage system then secure the catheter to the patient’s thigh
to prevent movement and irritation, as well as decrease risk of infection.
• Position the bag to avoid urine reflux into the bladder, kinking, or gross contamination
of the bag. Evaluate catheter function and amount, color, odor, and quality of urine.
• Document size of catheter inserted, amount of water in balloon, patient's response to
procedure, and assessment of urine.

Code: P-5

Title: Urethral Catheterization protocol

END

232

Key Points:
• If no urine is obtained, an assistant can be asked to apply gentle pressure to the suprapubic
region, which may initiate urine flow. In women, the insertion site of the catheter is examined; vaginal catheterization may have occurred. If this is the case, the catheter is removed
and a new sterile catheter used.
• If the patient complains of pain during catheter insertion, the catheter should be removed. If
blood appears at the meatus or on the tip of the catheter, a urethral injury may have
occurred. The procedure is abandoned.
• Both indwelling and intermittent urethral catheters are placed in a similar fashion. The
catheter used for intermittent catheterization is easier to insert; it is less bulky at the tip
because there is no balloon. While indwelling catheter placement is always performed with
sterile technique, intermittent catheterization can be performed with either sterile or nonsterile, clean technique.
• A typical urethral catheterization kit, it must include sterile gloves, drapes, antiseptic solution and sponges for periurethral cleansing, a single-use lubricant gel packet, urinary catheter, 5 mL syringe filled with sterile water for balloon inflation, and urine drainage system.

• Patient >12-year-old: 60-80bpm (ideally >30 bpm above patient’s initial rate).
• Patient <12-year-old: 100 bpm
This rate can be adjusted up or down (based on patient clinical response) once pacing
is established.
10. Note pacer spikes on ECG screen
11. Set initial current at Zero mA, slowly increase mA (Max 120 mA) until pacing spike
precedes each QRS. This represents electrical capture.
12. If capture observed on monitor, check for corresponding pulse and assess vital signs.
13. Confirm mechanical capture by checking for pulses.

235

PARAMEDIC

14. If unable to capture while at maximum current output, stop pacing immediately.
15. Reassess patient for signs of improved perfusion. If no improved perfusion or
mechanical capture - discontinue pacing.
16. Modify the current as needed to maintain effective pacing with both electrical
and mechanical capture.
17. Document the dysrhythmia and the response to external pacing with ECG strips in
the electronic Patient Care Report (EPCR).

Title: Needle Thoracostomy protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
Indication:

Tension Pneumothorax: Air leak into pleural space through a hole in lung, acting
as a one-way valve.

Assessment suggest tension pneumothorax by the following:
• Decreased breath sound, uni-or bilaterally
• Tracheal shift away from affected side
• Extreme dyspnea
• Neck vein distension
• Agitation
• Possible cyanosis
• Persistent Hypotension
• Hyper resonance to percussion
Location:

• ALTERNATE: 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line on the affected side.
Equipment:
EMT

PARAMEDIC

• PREFERRED: 4th or 5th intercostal space, mid-axillary, on the affected side.

• 10-gauge angiocath or other appropriate 14 gauge over the catheter needle.
• Large syringe
OR
Heimlich valve or similar one-way valve device.
Procedure:

1. Maintain airway and administer oxygen by non-rebreather face mask at 15 LPM.
2. Expose the entire chest.
3. Clean the affected side
4. Introduce either angiocath or other appropriate over the catheter needle
(attached to large syringe) just above the rib margin during expiration.
5. Continue until lack of resistance or "pop" as needle enters pleural space.
6. Once air returns under pressure or is aspirated with ease
a) Remove plunger.
b) Listen for air escaping.
7. Once air has ceased escaping:
a) Remove syringe barrel from needle.
b) Advance the catheter.
c) Secure catheter with needle guard or tape.
d) Attach one-way valve device or Heimlich valve with BLUE end toward patient.
247

9. Dress area with occlusive dressing then cover with sterile gauze pad
EMT

PARAMEDIC

8. Reassess lung sounds, pulses, tracheal deviation and patient clinical condition
10. Reassess breath sounds and respiratory status
11. Document Procedure, patient response, Vital signs and change in clinical
condition in the electronic Patient Care Report

Code: P-9

Title: Needle Thoracostomy protocol

END

Key Points:
• Confirmation of a successful decompression would include improved hemodynamic status
with improved respiratory effort, improved ETCO2 and/or pulse oximetry, equal rise & fall of
the chest, clear bi-lateral breath sounds.
• Tension pneumothorax is rare, but when present it must be treated immediately.
• Non-tension pneumothorax is relatively common, is not immediately life threatening and
should not be treated in the field.
• Positive pressure ventilation may lead to the development of a pneumothorax and to rapid
progression to tension pneumothorax.
• A needle decompression performed on a patient without a pneumothorax will cause a
pneumothorax.

Title: Mass casualty protocol

START

A mass casualty incident (MCI) is an incident where the number of patients exceeds
the amount of healthcare resources available.
The initial triage process should be performed by the first crew to arrive on scene
and needs to be continuously reevaluated since the patient's triage status may
change.
Maintain universal blood and body fluid precautions. Follow body surface isolation
protocol G-2
The initial response team should assess the scene for potential hazards, safety, and
number of victims to determine the appropriate level of response. Follow scene
size up protocol G-3.
Notify the dispatch to declare an MCI and need for overwhelming response as
defined by incident level. The dispatch should coordinate request for additional

END

278

KEY POINTS:
-

Ensure the patient’s age is entered for proper interpretation.

-

When transmitting either include the patient’s name or notify the receiving facility of the
patient’s identity.

-

Be alert for causes of artifact: dry or sweaty skin, dried out electrodes, patient movement,
cable movement, vehicle movement, electromagnetic interference, static electricity

-

According to manufacturers, dried out electrodes are a major source of artifact; keep in
original sealed foil pouches; plastic bags are not sufficient; use all the same kind of electrodes; press firmly around the edge of the electrode, not the center

-

Diaphoretic patients should be dried thoroughly. Clean the site using an alcohol prep pad,
a towel or 4X4 gauze

-

Check for subtle movement as a cause of artifact: toe tapping, shivering, muscle tension
(e.g. hand grasping rail or head raised to “watch”)

Code: P-18

Title: Orotracheal Intubation protocol

START

Follow General Patient Care Protocol go to G-1.
INDICATIONS
•

Failure to maintain open and patent airway.

•

Inadequate ventilation/oxygenation with basic airway procedures.

•

None if clinically indicated

CONTRAINDICATION
PROCEDURE

1. Prepare all equipment and have suction ready.
2. Pre-oxygenate the patient.
3. Position patient in 'sniffing position' and optimize alignment of ear to sternal notch.
4. Open the patient’s airway. While holding the laryngoscope in the left hand, insert
the blade into the right side of the patient’s mouth, sweeping the tongue to the left.
Use video laryngoscopy, if available and trained.

PARAMEDIC

5. Use the blade to lift the tongue and the epiglottis, either directly with the straight
(Miller) blade, or indirectly with the curved (Macintosh) blade.
6. Once the glottic opening is visualized, insert the tube through the vocal cords and
continue to visualize while passing the cuff through the cords.
7. Remove the laryngoscope and then the stylet from the ETT.
8. The ETT depth is (Size of tube X 3) from mouth opening.
9. Inflate the cuff with 5 – 10 mL of air.
10. Confirm appropriate proper placement by quantitative waveform capnography
symmetrical chest-wall rise, auscultation of equal breath sounds over the chest and a lack
of epigastric sounds with ventilations using bag-valve-mask, condensation in the ETT.
11. Secure the ETT, consider stabilizing head to protect the placement of the ETT.
12. Reassess tube placement frequently, especially after movement of the patient.
13. Ongoing monitoring of ETT placement and ventilation status using waveform
capnography is required for all patients.
14. Document each attempt (maximum of 3 attempts) as a separate procedure so it can
be time stamped in the EPCR. An attempt is defined as placement of the blade into the
patient’s mouth. For each attempt, document the time, provider, placement success,
pre-oxygenation, airway grade, ETT size, placement depth, placement landmark (e.g.
cm at the patient’s lip), and confirmation of tube placement including chest rise,
bilateral, equal breath sounds, absence of epigastric sounds and end-tidal CO2 readings.

282

If intubation attempt is unsuccessful, ETT placement cannot be verified or
ETT becomes dislodged:

• Monitor oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO2. AND
• Ventilate the patient with 100% oxygen via a BVM until ready to attempt
PARAMEDIC

intubation again.
• If continued intubation attempts are unsuccessful (maximum of 3 attempts), follow
difficult airway protocol P-2.

Techniques to improve laryngeal view:
• Head Elevation: Elevate the head by lifting with the laryngoscope or having an
assistant lift the head from underneath.
• External Laryngeal Manipulation (ELM): The person intubating uses their right hand
to manipulate the larynx to a position that is suitable. An assistant then holds the
larynx in that position. Note: BURP (backwards upwards rightwards pressure) and
cricoid pressure are no longer recommended.
• Jaw Thrust: An assistant performs a jaw thrust to assist with tissue displacement.
For post-tube care, follow post-tube placement care protocol P-21.

Nasotracheal Intubation

285

Code: P - 19

Title: Nasotracheal Intubation

START

Indications:
Physical restrict for proper positioning for oral intubation.
Impending respiratory failure with intact gag reflex or if jaw is clenched and
unable to be opened.
Contraindications:
•

Apnea.

•

Nasal obstruction.

•

Suspected basilar skull fracture.

Procedure:

1. Explain the procedure to conscious patients.
2. Pre-medicate nasal mucosa with 2% lidocaine jelly and nasal decongestant
spray, and/or Benzocaine Spray if available.
3. Pre-oxygenate the patient.
4. Select the largest and least obstructed nostril and insert a lubricated nasal

PARAMEDIC

airway to help dilate the nasal passage.
5. Select appropriate ETT size. It is recommended to start with a 7.0 ETT and
adjust based on nostril size.
6. Lubricate the ETT with water-based lubricant.
7. Remove the nasal airway and gently insert the ETT with continuous
quantitative waveform capnography monitoring, keeping the bevel toward the
septum (a gentle rotation movement may be necessary at the turbinates).
8. Continue to advance the ETT while listening for maximum air movement and
watching for capnography wave form.
9. At the point of maximum air movement, indicating proximity to the level of
the glottis, gently and evenly advance the tube through the glottic opening on
inspiration
10. If resistance is encountered, the tube may have become lodged into the
pyriform sinus and you may note tenting of the skin on either side of the thyroid
cartilage. If this happens, slightly withdraw the ETT and rotate it toward the
midline and attempt to advance tube again with the next inspiration.
11. Upon entering the trachea, the tube may cause the patient to cough, strain,
or gag. This is normal. Do not remove the ETT. Be prepared to control the cervical
spine and the patient, and be alert for vomiting.
12. Placement depth should be from the nares to the tip of the tube:
approximately 28cm in males and 26 cm in females.
13. Inflate cuff with 5 – 10 mL of air.
286

14. Confirm appropriate placement by quantitative waveform capnography.
Symmetrical chest-wall rise, auscultation of equal breath sounds over the chest and a

PARAMEDIC

lack of epigastric sounds with bagging, and condensation in the ETT.
15. Secure the ETT, consider applying a cervical-collar (even for the medical patient)
to protect the placement of the ETT.
16. Ongoing monitoring of ETT placement and ventilation status using waveform
capnography is required for all patients.
17. If continued intubation attempts are unsuccessful (maximum of 3 attempts)
follow difficult airway protocol P-2.
For post-tube care, follow post-tube placement care protocol P-21.

Indications:
• Cardiac Arrest.
• Inability to adequately ventilate a patient with a bag-valve-mask or longer EMS transports requiring a more definitive airway.
• Anticipated difficulty in Airway.
• Back up device for failed endotracheal intubation attempt.
Contraindications:
• Ability to maintain oxygenation and ventilation by less invasive methods, such as
Bag-Valve Mask ventilation.
• Intact gag reflex.
• Tracheotomy or laryngectomy.
• Suspected Foreign Body Airway Obstruction.

PARAMEDIC

• Active vomiting
• Severe maxillofacial or oral trauma.
• Latex allergy.
• For devices inserted into the esophagus:
-

The patient has known esophageal disease.

-

The patient has ingested a caustic substance.

-

The patient has burns involving the airway.

• (Relative Contraindication):
Patient size outside of manufacturer recommended range for airway size used. The
supraglottic airway may be utilized in such patients if the fit of the airway allows for
appropriate oxygenation and ventilation of the patient.
Procedure:
1. Hold the supraglottic airway at the connector with dominant hand (right hand dominant).
2. With non – dominant hand, hold mouth open and apply chin lift, unless contraindicated by C – spine precautions or patient position.
3. With a lateral approach from the right, introduce tip into mouth.
4. Laryngoscope may allow easier oropharynx passage.
5. Advance the tip behind the base of the tongue while rotating tube back to midline, so
that the blue orientation line faces the chin of the patient.

289

6. Without exerting excessive force, advance tube until base of connector is aligned
with teeth or gums
7. Inflate cuffs with supplied syringe – use minimum mL necessary to achieve seal for
appropriate oxygenation/ventilation. Excessive cuff inflation may compromise cerebral
blood flow!
8. Attach bag-valve to supraglottic airway.
9. Gently ventilate the patient while withdrawing the tube until ventilation is easy
(without significant resistance)
PARAMEDIC

10. Confirm appropriate placement by symmetrical chest-wall rise, auscultation of equal
breath sounds over the chest and a lack of epigastric sounds with bag valve mask ventilation, and quantitative waveform capnography.
11. Secure the device.

293

KEY POINTS:
• CAUTION: Relative contraindications to midazolam: Suspected or known intracranial process, need for frequent or repeat neurologic exams.
• Analgesia and sedation should be considered in all patients with advanced airways in place,
especially any time a patient shows signs of distress or there is difficulty providing appropriate ventilation due to patient resistance.
• Administering analgesia prior to anxiolysis has been shown to decrease the amount of
benzodiazepine needed.
• Ketamine has analgesic properties and therefore does not require fentanyl to be coadministered.
• Ketamine IV boluses should be pushed slowly, over at least 30-60 seconds.
• Sedation can be guided by the RASS scale shown above with a target RASS of -3 to -5.
• Patients usually require more sedation in the prehospital environment than in-hospital due
to increased external stimuli.
• Lower doses of the medication listed should be considered in the setting of hemodynamic
compromise.

Do Not Resuscitate
(DNR) protocol

296

Code: S-1

Title: Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) protocol

START

Identify that the patient is the person named in the DNR directive through a reliable
witness or the presence of a picture identification or band/tag.
Provide supportive palliative care and transport all patients with a DNR directive who
are not in need of immediate resuscitation.
Ignore the DNR form and provide care according to protocol and need if the patient is
conscious and states he/she want resuscitative measures.
CPR may be withheld or discontinued when responding to a pulseless and apneic
patient with the following approved valid DNR directive:
•

Prehospital DNR Form issued by a medical authority in the country.

•

When responding to a licensed health facility, a written DNR order signed by a

physician in the patient’s medical record. Document in the field PCR the presence of a
physician signed DNR from the facility records along with date of the order, and the
physician's name.

PARAMEDIC

•

EMS personnel may accept only a written DNR order from a physician present on

scene in a non-health care setting and who reasonably identifies himself/herself as the
patient's physician.
CPR may be discontinued without On-line medical director contact if a valid DNR
directive is located by EMS personnel after CPR has started.
If any question exists regarding the validity of the DNR directive, or if there is any
disagreement by the patient's family members or caretakers as to honoring the DNR
directive. EMS personnel should initiate BLS, treat the patient in accordance with
applicable treatment protocols, and immediately contact On-line medical director for
further instructions.
DNR directives are honored during an inter-facility transport. If a patient dies while en
route, transport of the body should continue to the designated receiving facility.
EMS personnel shall document the presence of a DNR directive on the prehospital care
record.
Copies of the DNR directive should be attached to the field EPCR. If the patient is
transported, a copy of the form should be taken with the patient to the receiving
facility and given to the facility staff.
If an ambulance provider dispatch center is informed about a DNR directive, the
dispatcher shall instruct the caller to get the directive and present it to the emergency
responders when they arrive. Caller information that a patient has a DNR directive
does not change the ambulance or code.

297

PARAMEDIC

First responders may cancel or downgrade the ambulance response if the patient is
pulseless and apneic and there is a DNR directive. Otherwise, the ambulance shall
respond as dispatched.
Contact medical control and inform him about the presence of DNR directive and
document that in EPCR

Code: S-4

Title: Chemical and Mechanical Restrains

START

INDICATIONS: Patients who are a potential harm to themselves or others, or
interfere with their own care and lack the ability to refuse care under the Refusal
of Care Protocol may be restrained to prevent injury to the patient or crew and
facilitate necessary medical care.
Restraining must be performed in a humane manner and used only as a last resort.
PROCEDURE:
1. Request law enforcement assistance, as necessary.
2. When appropriate, attempt less restrictive means of managing the patient,
including verbal de-escalation.
3. Ensure that there are sufficient personnel available to physically restrain the
4. Restrain the patient in a lateral or supine position. No devices such as

PARAMEDIC

patient safely.
backboards, splints, or other devices may be placed on top of the patient. Never
hog-tie a patient. In order to gain control, the patient may need to be in a prone
position, but must be moved to supine or lateral position as soon as possible.
5. The patient must be under constant observation at all times. This includes direct
visualization of the patient as well as cardiac, pulse oximetry, and quantitative
waveform capnography monitoring, if available.
6. The extremities that are restrained should have a circulation check at least every
15 minutes. The first of these checks should occur as soon possible after restraints
are placed.
7. Documentation should include the reason for the use of restraints, the type of
restraints used, the time restraints were placed, and circulation checks.
8. If a patient is restrained by law enforcement personnel with handcuffs or other
devices that EMS personnel cannot remove, a law enforcement officer should
accompany the patient to the hospital in the transporting ambulance. If this is not
feasible, the officer MUST follow directly behind the transporting ambulance to
the receiving hospital.
Resistant or Aggressive Management (Resisting necessary treatment/interventions)
Goal is alert and calm, consider:
Midazolam 2- 6 mg IV/IM/IN, may repeat once in 10 minutes OR
Lorazepam 2 mg IM, may repeat once in 10 minutes; or 1 mg IV, may repeat once in
5 minutes;
OR
Diazepam 5 mg IV/IM (IV preferred route), may repeat once in 10 minutes.

306

For patients with suspected Excited/Agitated Delirium (Immediate danger to self/others)
OR extreme agitation OR ineffective control with benzodiazepines. Goal is safe and
compliant:
Ketamine 4 mg/kg IM rounded to nearest 50 mg, maximum dose 500 mg, repeat 100
mg IM in 5 to 10 minutes. OR
Midazolam 10 mg IM/IN/IV, (IM Preferred route) may repeat once in 10 minutes. OR
Lorazepam 2 mg IM, may repeat once in 10 minutes; or 1 mg IV, may repeat once in 5
minutes. OR
Diazepam 10 mg IV (preferred route), may repeat once in 5 minutes; or 5 mg IM, may
repeat once in 20 minutes
Consider in addition to benzodiazepines:
Haloperidol 10 mg IM; may repeat once in 10 minutes.
PARAMEDIC

After chemical restraint, re-evaluate whether the patient continues to meet criteria for
physical restraint and remove if they are no longer necessary to ensure the safety of the
patient, providers or both, considering transport times, the depth of sedation and the
need to transfer the patient at destination.
Check v/s before and after administering any medication.
Resistant or Aggressive Management (Resisting necessary treatment/interventions)
Contact Medical Control, to discuss treatment options.
Violent and/or Excited Delirium Management (Immediate danger to self/others) Target
Goal is safe and compliant, consider:
Contact Medical Control and consider:
Ketamine 4 mg/kg IM rounded to nearest 25 mg, maximum dose 250 mg, repeat x 1 in
5-10 minutes OR
Midazolam 5 mg/mL concentration (IM or IN preferred):
• 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN (single maximum dose 8 mg) repeat every 5 minutes; or
• 0.1 mg/kg IV (single maximum dose 4 mg) repeat every 5 minutes, OR
Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (single maximum dose 4 mg) repeat every 5 minutes, OR
Diazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (single maximum dose 5 mg IV) repeat every 5 minutes.
If cardiac arrest occurs with suspected excited delirium, consider early administration of:
fluid bolus, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride/gluconate
Contact Medical Control for additional doses of above.

• Continued patient struggling against restraints may lead to hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis,
and/or cardiac arrest. Chemical restraint may be necessary to prevent continued forceful struggling by the patient.
• Excited/Agitated Delirium is characterized by extreme restlessness, irritability, and/or high fever.
Patients exhibiting these signs are at high risk for sudden death.
• Administer haloperidol with caution to patients who are already on psychotropic medications
which may precipitate serotonin syndrome or malignant hyperthermia.
• Placing a patient in prone position creates a severe risk of airway and ventilation compromise
and death.

316

Code: S-7

Title: Bariatric Triage, Care, and transport

START

Definitions
A bariatric patient is a patient:
• Weight exceeds 180 Kg OR
• Weight, girth, body contours and/or co-morbidities challenge the ability of a
two-person EMS crew to effectively manage.
Dispatch:

• Bariatric Ambulance:
-

Consider requesting a bariatric transport ambulance to respond to the scene.
The arrival on scene of a bariatric ambulance may require between 30 and 90
minutes, and should be requested as soon as it becomes clear that bariatric
capabilities may be required. The use of a specialized bariatric stretcher increases
the ability to provide effective care, is more comfortable for the patient and

• Additional Manpower:
EMT

PARAMEDIC

enhances provider safety.
-

Consider requesting additional responders. In general, bariatric patients should
be moved with a minimum of personnel. Larger bariatric patients may require
additional personnel to participate in moving the patient.

-

For significant extrications, consider contacting the Civil Defense. It may be
necessary to remove doors, walls or windows to carry out a safe extrication.

• Additional Expertise:
Consider requesting a paramedic. Even BLS bariatric patients present unique
treatment challenges which may benefit from a higher level of care.
Medical Care:
-

Providers should use appropriately sized equipment to the extent it is available or
can be readily obtained. For example, an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff
will need to be used and intramuscular injection will be given with a longer needle.

-

If there are significant barriers to removing the patient from the structure in a
timely manner (long narrow stairs, patient in the attic, etc.), there may be
situations where EMS will provide extended care to the patient at the scene. In
such cases, consult Medical Control.

Transfer to Ambulance
-

If a bariatric equipment cache is utilized, both the bariatric ambulance and cache
equipment needs to be dispatched.

317

-

Be sure before you use any patient transfer device that you understand the
procedure for using it safely and that you know the weight limits of the device.

-

At no time should a patient who weighs more than 135 Kg be moved without at least four individuals to assist. At the scene, EMS and fire personnel
may be supplemented by other public safety personnel as appropriate. For
every 22.5 kg to 45 Kg more than 135 Kg, add another provider to assist in
safe lifting and movement of the patient.

Hospital Destination
-

Ensure that you select a destination hospital that has the capabilities to care
for your patient.

-

Bariatric patients may require specialized hospital stretchers, CT scanners,

-

It may be appropriate to bypass a local hospital to take the patient to a facility with the capabilities to properly care for the patient. This may even be

EMT

PARAMEDIC

catheterization, laboratory equipment, operating room equipment, etc.

appropriate in the case of life-threatening emergencies if the closer emergency department does not have needed equipment.
-

Pre-notification serves both to ensure that the hospital is capable of caring for
the patient and allows hospital staff time for adequate preparation. Communication with the hospital shall be in a professional manner. Respect for the
patient's privacy and feelings will match the respect for all EMS patients.

Transport to the Hospital
-

A bariatric stretcher should be used to transport the patient to the hospital
and equipment cache transfer devices may be utilized to facilitate transfer of
the patient to the hospital stretcher.

-

Be alert to ensure that the stretcher is adequately secured in the patient
compartment.

-

Transfer flats or other specialized transfer equipment may be left in place to
facilitate transfer of the patient to the hospital stretcher.

Key Points:
•

It may be difficult to establish IV and IO access. Consider intramuscular or intranasal as

alternatives for some medications. For IM, ensure that the needle used is sufficiently long.
•

Weight-based calculations may yield inappropriately large doses in obese patients.

Consult with medical control when in doubt.
•

Bariatric patients often have decreased functional residual capacity, and are at risk of

rapid desaturation. Extremely obese individuals require more oxygen than non-obese individuals due to their diminished lung capacity. Pulse oximetry may not be reliable due to poor
circulation. Even patients without respiratory distress may not tolerate the supine position.
•

Bariatric patients may present with severe airway challenges. try to protect airway as

soon as possible and contact medical control for further instructions.
•

If the patient has had recent bariatric surgery, possible complications may include

anemia, dehydration, leakage, ulcers, localized infection, sepsis, etc.
